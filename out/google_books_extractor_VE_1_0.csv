Aral]","[Science]","This book is intended to serve as a comprehensive source for the advancements and contributions made in environmental transformation and transport modeling in general and the associated health risk assessment topics in particular. The selection of the title, Environmental Modeling and Health Risk Analysis stems from an ambitious objective of providing a review of air, surface water and groundwater quality modeling topics and linking these models with exposure and health risk analysis. Thus, the purpose is to provide the reader with an integrated perspective on these two seemingly distant fields. The ACTS and RISK software that is an integral part of this book include computational platforms for all models discussed in the book. Using these two software tools, available from http://extras.springer.com/ , the models described in the book can be readily accessed and used in classroom or professional applications as demonstrated in the book.","2010-07-28","http://books.google.es/books?id=xRV6FFW4qlQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","9048186080",
"Credit Risk Management: Basic Concepts: Financial Risk Components, Rating Analysis, Models, Economic and Regulatory Capital","intitle:risk","[Tony Van Gestel, Bart Baesens]","[Business & Economics]","Credit Risk Management: Basic Concepts is the first book of a series of three with the objective of providing an overview of all aspects, steps, and issues that should be considered when undertaking credit risk management, including the Basel II Capital Accord, which all major banks must comply with in 2008. The introduction of the recently suggested Basel II Capital Accord has raised many issues and concerns about how to appropriately manage credit risk. Managing credit risk is one of the next big challenges facing financial institutions. The importance and relevance of efficiently managing credit risk is evident from the huge investments that many financial institutions are making in this area, the booming credit industry in emerging economies (e.g. Brazil, China, India, ...), the many events (courses, seminars, workshops, ...) that are being organised on this topic, and the emergence of new academic journals and magazines in the field (e.g. Journal of Credit Risk, Journal of Risk Model Validation, Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions, ...). Basic Concepts provides the introduction to the concepts, techniques, and practical examples to guide both young and experienced practitioners and academics in the fascinating, but complex world of risk modelling. Financial risk management, an area of increasing importance with the recent Basel II developments, is discussed in terms of practical business impact and the increasing profitability competition, laying the foundation for books II and III.","2008-10-23","http://books.google.es/books?id=aXP7xjN5o00C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","0191609307",

"Risk Perceptions, Risk Preferences, Risk Ambiguity, and Flood Insurance","intitle:risk",,"[Flood insurance]","This thesis presents an analysis of subjective risk information and participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Data are taken from a survey of residents in flood-prone coastal regions in the southeastern U.S. Regression models are constructed to better understand factors affecting individuals' perceived risk ambiguity related to flood risk and the role of risk preferences, risk perceptions, and especially risk ambiguity, on the decision to purchase flood insurance. This is the first study not only of the influence of risk ambiguity on NFIP participation, but also of the impact of using different risk perception measures. Results indicate that NFIP participation is significantly affected by mean perceived risk, but the influence of range/variance of perceived risk, which presents one's perceived ambiguity, is mixed.","2012","http://books.google.es/books?id=xJk-nQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api","OCLC:806515412",

"Market Risk Analysis, Value at Risk Models","intitle:risk","[Carol Alexander]","[Business & Economics]","Written by leading market risk academic, Professor Carol Alexander, Value-at-Risk Models forms part four of the Market Risk Analysis four volume set. Building on the three previous volumes this book provides by far the most comprehensive, rigorous and detailed treatment of market VaR models. It rests on the basic knowledge of financial mathematics and statistics gained from Volume I, of factor models, principal component analysis, statistical models of volatility and correlation and copulas from Volume II and, from Volume III, knowledge of pricing and hedging financial instruments and of mapping portfolios of similar instruments to risk factors. A unifying characteristic of the series is the pedagogical approach to practical examples that are relevant to market risk analysis in practice. All together, the Market Risk Analysis four volume set illustrates virtually every concept or formula with a practical, numerical example or a longer, empirical case study. Across all four volumes there are approximately 300 numerical and empirical examples, 400 graphs and figures and 30 case studies many of which are contained in interactive Excel spreadsheets available from the the accompanying CD-ROM . Empirical examples and case studies specific to this volume include: Parametric linear value at risk (VaR)models: normal, Student t and normal mixture and their expected tail loss (ETL); New formulae for VaR based on autocorrelated returns; Historical simulation VaR models: how to scale historical VaR and volatility adjusted historical VaR; Monte Carlo simulation VaR models based on multivariate normal and Student t distributions, and based on copulas; Examples and case studies of numerous applications to interest rate sensitive, equity, commodity and international portfolios; Decomposition of systematic VaR of large portfolios into standard alone and marginal VaR components; Backtesting and the assessment of risk model risk; Hypothetical factor push and historical stress tests, and stress testing based on VaR and ETL.","2009-01-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=e03cHzItv0AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=58&source=gbs_api","9780470745076",

"An Analysis of Transfer Risk in Comparison to Sovereign Risk","intitle:risk","[Philipp Hauger]","[Business & Economics]","Transfer risk is the risk that a non-sovereign entity, which is able and willing to service its foreign currency obligations, cannot obtain the required currency or cannot transfer this money to the receiver abroad. This transfer inability is caused by the imposition of restrictions on convertibility or capital transfers by the government. Transfer risk applies to all types of international investments, especially in emerging market countries. Due to this, it is more important than ever in these days of globalization. The New Basel Capital Accords require the consideration of transfer risk, too. The author Philipp Hauger describes the different types of risk occurring in international borrowings and investments. The political and corporate determinants of transfer risk are examined. The book illustrates the reasons why monetary unions reduce the risk of a transfer event, even though they have no influence on the sovereign risk. In addition, the author details how transfer risk is assessed by international professionals and describes two interesting approaches to estimate transfer risk in a quantitative way. This book is intended for professionals and students who are interested in the risks of international investments and for everybody working in international business, who has to differentiate between sovereign risk and the risk of a corporate default.","2006-10-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=l0NPQM46vFIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api","9783638559454",

The volume also offers an often chilling historical examination of the use of volunteers in chemical warfare experiments by the U.S. military--what the then-young soldiers were told prior to the experiments, how they were ""encouraged"" to remain in the program, and how they were treated afterward.

"At Risk. Natural Hazards, People's Vulnerability and Disasters","intitle:risk","[Benjamin Wisner]","[Science]","The term 'natural disaster' is often used to refer to natural events such as earthquakes, hurricanes or floods. However, the phrase 'natural disaster' suggests an uncritical acceptance of a deeply engrained ideological and cultural myth. At Risk questions this myth and argues that extreme natural events are not disasters until a vulnerable group of people is exposed. The updated new edition confronts a further ten years of ever more expensive and deadly disasters and discusses disaster not as an aberration, but as a signal failure of mainstream 'development'. Two analytical models are provided as tools for understanding vulnerability. One links remote and distant 'root causes' to 'unsafe conditions' in a 'progression of vulnerability'. The other uses the concepts of 'access' and 'livelihood' to understand why some households are more vulnerable than others. Examining key natural events and incorporating strategies to create a safer world, this revised edition is an important resource for those involved in the fields of environment and development studies.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=qMmvGH1Ce64C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=105&source=gbs_api","0415252156",

"Uncontrolled Risk: Lessons of Lehman Brothers and How Systemic Risk Can Still Bring Down the World Financial System","intitle:risk","[Mark Williams]","[Business & Economics]","How Excessive Risk Destroyed Lehman and Nearly Brought Down the Financial Industry Uncontrolled Risk will ruffle feathersand for good reasonas voters and legislators learn the diffi cult lessons of Lehmans collapse and demand that we never forget them. Dr. David C. Shimko, Board of Trustees, Global Association of Risk Professionals Uncontrolled Risk is a drama as gripping as any work of fiction. Williamss recommendations for changes in the governance of financial institutions should be of interest to anyone concerned about the welfare of global financial markets. Geoffrey Miller, Stuyvesant Comfort Professor of Law and Director, Center for the Study of Central Banks and Financial Institutions, New York University The complex balance of free enterprise on Wall Street and the healthy regulation of its participants is the central economic issue of today. Williamss forensic study of Lehmans collapse may be the best perspective so far on the issues that now face regulators. Jeffrey P. Davis, CFA, Chief Investment Officer, Lee Munder Capital Group Provides a very perceptive analysis of the fl aws inherent in risk management systems and modern fi nancial markets. Mandatory reading for risk managers and financial industry executives. Vincent Kaminski, Professor in the Practice of Management, Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business, Rice University Gives the reader much food for thought on the regulation of our financial system and its interplay with corporate governance reform in the United States and around the world. Professor Charles M. Elson, Edgar S. Woolard Jr. Chair in Corporate Governance, University of Delaware The risk taking behind Wall Street's largest bankruptcy . . . In this dramatic and compelling account of Lehman Brothers spectacular rise and fall, author Mark T. Williams explains how uncontrolled risk toppled a 158-year-old institutionand what it says about Wall Street, Washington, D.C., and the world financial system. A former trading floor executive and Fed bank examiner, Williams sees Lehmans 2008 collapse as a microcosm of the industrya worst-case scenario of smart decisions, stupid mistakes, ignored warnings, and important lessons in money, power, and policy that affect us all. This book reveals: The Congressional inquisition of disgraced CEO Dick Fuld: Did he really deserve it? How the investment-banking money machine broke down: Can it be fixed? The key drivers that caused the financial meltdown: Can lessons be learned from them? The wild risk taking denounced by President Obama: Is Washington to blame, too? The ongoing debate on reform and regulation: Can meaningful reform avert another financial catastrophe? This fascinating account traces Lehmans history from its humble beginnings in 1850 to its collapse in 2008. Lehmans story exemplifies the everchanging trends in financefrom investment vehicles to federal policiesand exposes the danger and infectious nature of uncontrolled risk. Drawing upon first-person interviews with risk management experts and former Lehman employees, Williams provides more than just a frontline report: its a call to action for Wall Street bankers, Washington policymakers, and U.S. citizensa living lesson in risk management on which to build a stronger fi nancial future. Williams provides a tenpoint plan to implement todayso another Lehman doesnt collapse tomorrow. Includes a ten-point plan to ensure a strong financial future for both Wall Street and Main Street","2010-03-26","http://books.google.es/books?id=HSkjB_PGp98C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=107&source=gbs_api","9780071749046",

"On the Feasibility of TBM Drives in Squeezing Ground and the Risk of Shield Jamming","intitle:risk","[Marco Ramoni]","[Drilling and boring machinery]","Squeezing ground represents a challenging operating environment as it may slow down or obstruct TBM operation. Due to the geometrical constraints of the equipment, relatively small convergences of 10-20 cm may lead to considerable difficulties in the machine area (sticking of the cutter head, jamming of the shield) or in the back-up area (e.g., jamming of the back-up equipment, inadmissible convergences of the bored profile, damage to the tunnel support). Depending on the number and the length of the critical stretches, squeezing conditions may even call into question the feasibility of a TBM drive. On account of this, and bearing in mind the steady increase in the number of tunnels excavated with TBMs through so-called ""difficult ground conditions"", the topic investigated in this PhD thesis is of great practical relevance.Based upon case histories reported in the literature, Part I sets out firstly to give an overview of the specific problems of TBM tunnelling under squeezing conditions. Part II presents a computational model which simulates accurately and efficiently the advancing TBM and the installed tunnel support in one single computational step applying the so-called ""steady state method"". Part III advances a number of theory-based decision aids, which will support rapid, initial assessments to be made of thrust force requirements. Part IV investigates the complex problem of the interaction between the advancing TBM, the consolidating ground and the lining. Emphasis is thereby placed on the effect of the gross advance rate and the effect of ground permeability on shield loading during regular TBM operation (the boring process including short standstills) and during a long standstill.","2010","http://books.google.es/books?id=3eJkqtZ2CwcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=109&source=gbs_api","9783728133632",

"Risk Savvy. How To Make Good Decisions","intitle:risk","[Gerd Gigerenzer]","[Self-Help]","A fascinating, practical guide to making better decisions with our money, health and personal lives from Gerd Gigerenzer, the author of Reckoning with Risk. Risk-taking is essential for innovation, fun, and the courage to face the uncertainties in life. Yet for many important decisions, we're often presented with statistics and probabilities that we don't really understand and we inevitably rely on experts in the relevant fields - policy makers, financial advisors, doctors - to analyse and choose for us. But what if they don't quite understand the way the information is presented either? How do we make sure we're asking doctors the right questions about proposed treatment? Is there a rule of thumb that could help choose the right partner? This entertaining book shows us how to recognize when we don't have all the information and know what to do about it. Gerd Gigerenzer looks at examples from every aspect of life to identify the reasons for our collective misunderstanding of the risks we face. He shows how we can all use simple rules to avoid being manipulated into unrealistic fears or hopes, to make better-informed decisions, and to learn to understand risk and uncertainty in our own lives. 'Gigerenzer is brilliant and his topic is fabulous' Steven Pinker 'Catchily optimistic and slyly funny' Guardian Gerd Gigerenzer is Director of the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin and former Professor of Psychology at the University of Chicago.

"Quantifying Systemic Risk","intitle:risk","[Joseph G. Haubrich, Andrew W. Lo]","[Business & Economics]","In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, the federal government has pursued significant regulatory reforms, including proposals to measure and monitor systemic risk. However, there is much debate about how this might be accomplished quantitatively and objectivelyor whether this is even possible. A key issue is determining the appropriate trade-offs between risk and reward from a policy and social welfare perspective given the potential negative impact of crises. One of the first books to address the challenges of measuring statistical risk from a system-wide persepective, Quantifying Systemic Risk looks at the means of measuring systemic risk and explores alternative approaches. Among the topics discussed are the challenges of tying regulations to specific quantitative measures, the effects of learning and adaptation on the evolution of the market, and the distinction between the shocks that start a crisis and the mechanisms that enable it to grow.","2013-01-24","http://books.google.es/books?id=cemEjRqwXFwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=117&source=gbs_api","0226921964",
