The selection of the title, Environmental Modeling and Health Risk Analysis stems from an ambitious objective of providing a review of air, surface water and groundwater quality modeling topics and linking these models with exposure and health risk analysis. Thus, the purpose is to provide the reader with an integrated perspective on these two seemingly distant fields. The ACTS and RISK software that is an integral part of this book include computational platforms for all models discussed in the book. Using these two software tools, available from http://extras.springer.com/ , the models described in the book can be readily accessed and used in classroom or professional applications as demonstrated in the book.","2010-07-28","http://books.google.es/books?id=xRV6FFW4qlQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","9048186080",

"Risk Perceptions, Risk Preferences, Risk Ambiguity, and Flood Insurance","intitle:risk",,"[Flood insurance]","This thesis presents an analysis of subjective risk information and participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Data are taken from a survey of residents in flood-prone coastal regions in the southeastern U.S. Regression models are constructed to better understand factors affecting individuals' perceived risk ambiguity related to flood risk and the role of risk preferences, risk perceptions, and especially risk ambiguity, on the decision to purchase flood insurance. This is the first study not only of the influence of risk ambiguity on NFIP participation, but also of the impact of using different risk perception measures. Results indicate that NFIP participation is significantly affected by mean perceived risk, but the influence of range/variance of perceived risk, which presents one's perceived ambiguity, is mixed.","2012","http://books.google.es/books?id=xJk-nQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=42&source=gbs_api","OCLC:806515412",

"Market Risk Analysis, Value at Risk Models","intitle:risk","[Carol Alexander]","[Business & Economics]","Written by leading market risk academic, Professor Carol Alexander, Value-at-Risk Models forms part four of the Market Risk Analysis four volume set. Building on the three previous volumes this book provides by far the most comprehensive, rigorous and detailed treatment of market VaR models. It rests on the basic knowledge of financial mathematics and statistics gained from Volume I, of factor models, principal component analysis, statistical models of volatility and correlation and copulas from Volume II and, from Volume III, knowledge of pricing and hedging financial instruments and of mapping portfolios of similar instruments to risk factors. A unifying characteristic of the series is the pedagogical approach to practical examples that are relevant to market risk analysis in practice. All together, the Market Risk Analysis four volume set illustrates virtually every concept or formula with a practical, numerical example or a longer, empirical case study.

"An Analysis of Transfer Risk in Comparison to Sovereign Risk","intitle:risk","[Philipp Hauger]","[Business & Economics]","Transfer risk is the risk that a non-sovereign entity, which is able and willing to service its foreign currency obligations, cannot obtain the required currency or cannot transfer this money to the receiver abroad. This transfer inability is caused by the imposition of restrictions on convertibility or capital transfers by the government. Transfer risk applies to all types of international investments, especially in emerging market countries. Due to this, it is more important than ever in these days of globalization. The New Basel Capital Accords require the consideration of transfer risk, too. The author Philipp Hauger describes the different types of risk occurring in international borrowings and investments. The political and corporate determinants of transfer risk are examined. The book illustrates the reasons why monetary unions reduce the risk of a transfer event, even though they have no influence on the sovereign risk. In addition, the author details how transfer risk is assessed by international professionals and describes two interesting approaches to estimate transfer risk in a quantitative way. This book is intended for professionals and students who are interested in the risks of international investments and for everybody working in international business, who has to differentiate between sovereign risk and the risk of a corporate default.","2006-10-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=l0NPQM46vFIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=70&source=gbs_api","9783638559454",

"The Rhetoric of Risk. Technical Documentation in Hazardous Environments","intitle:risk","[Beverly A. Sauer]","[TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING]","The crash of an Amtrak train near Baltimore, the collapse of the Hyatt hotel in Kansas City, the incident at Three Mile Island, and other large-scale technological disasters have provided powerful examples of the ways that communication practices influence the events and decisions that precipitate a disaster. These examples have raised ethical questions about the responsibility of writers within agencies, epistemological questions about the nature of representation in science, and rhetorical questions about the nature of expertise and experience as grounds for judgments about risk. In The Rhetoric of Risk: Technical Documentation in Hazardous Environments, author Beverly Sauer examines how the dynamic uncertainty of the material environment affects communication in large regulatory industries. Sauer's analysis focuses specifically on mine safety, which provides a rich technical and historical context where problems of rhetorical agency, narrative, and the negotiation of meaning have visible and tragic outcomes. But the questions Sauer asks have larger implication for risk and safety: How does writing function in large regulatory industries? What can we learn from experience? Why is this experience so difficult to capture in writing? What information is lost when agencies rely on written documentation alone? Given the uncertainties, how can we work to improve communication in hazardous and uncertain environments? By exploring how individuals make sense of the material, technical, and institutional indeterminancies of their work in speech and gesture, The Rhetoric of Risk helps communicators rethink their frequently unquestioned assumptions about workplace discourse and the role of writers in hazardous worksites. It is intended for scholars and students in technical writing and communication, rhetoric, risk analysis and risk communication, as well as a wide range of engineering and technical fields concerned with risk, safety, and uncertainty.","2003-01-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=MpEAoMcFNJ8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=90&source=gbs_api","9781135654870",

Attention is devoted to the regulative frameworks implemented to guarantee the safety of the food chain against the BSE menace and at the liability responses sketched to compensate the victims of mad cow disease, showing how both these elements have been influenced by the cultural context within which they place themselves.","2009-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=6sfjuoN8zZ0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=94&source=gbs_api","0754678113",

The volume also offers an often chilling historical examination of the use of volunteers in chemical warfare experiments by the U.S. military--what the then-young soldiers were told prior to the experiments, how they were ""encouraged"" to remain in the program, and how they were treated afterward.

"At Risk. Natural Hazards, People's Vulnerability and Disasters","intitle:risk","[Benjamin Wisner]","[Science]","The term 'natural disaster' is often used to refer to natural events such as earthquakes, hurricanes or floods. However, the phrase 'natural disaster' suggests an uncritical acceptance of a deeply engrained ideological and cultural myth. At Risk questions this myth and argues that extreme natural events are not disasters until a vulnerable group of people is exposed. The updated new edition confronts a further ten years of ever more expensive and deadly disasters and discusses disaster not as an aberration, but as a signal failure of mainstream 'development'. Two analytical models are provided as tools for understanding vulnerability. One links remote and distant 'root causes' to 'unsafe conditions' in a 'progression of vulnerability'. The other uses the concepts of 'access' and 'livelihood' to understand why some households are more vulnerable than others. Examining key natural events and incorporating strategies to create a safer world, this revised edition is an important resource for those involved in the fields of environment and development studies.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=qMmvGH1Ce64C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=108&source=gbs_api","0415252156",

"Racial Identity, Masculinity and Homosexuality in the Lives of Young Black Men who Have Sex with Men: Implications for HIV Risk","intitle:risk","[Errol Lamont Fields]",,"Background. Young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) carry a disparate burden of HIV infection. A recent study reports an HIV prevalence of 16% among young Black MSM 15-22 compared to 6.9% in Latino MSM and 3.3% in white MSM in 7 urban centers (Harawa et al., 2004). Moreover, although rates of unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) are similar, young Black MSM in these settings have an odds ratio of HIV infection that is 9 times that of young white MSM (Harawa et al., 2004). The similar rates of UAI across racial and ethnic groups suggest a need to examine other, more complex factors. Accordingly, this study explores multiple disciplines and theoretical concepts that may be pertinent to HIV risk in this population including identity and identity development, social norms and normative influence, and theories of masculinity and gender role conflict.","2009","http://books.google.es/books?id=YJhoKwODS-8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=121&source=gbs_api","1109139152",
"On the Feasibility of TBM Drives in Squeezing Ground and the Risk of Shield Jamming","intitle:risk","[Marco Ramoni]","[Drilling and boring machinery]","Squeezing ground represents a challenging operating environment as it may slow down or obstruct TBM operation. Due to the geometrical constraints of the equipment, relatively small convergences of 10-20 cm may lead to considerable difficulties in the machine area (sticking of the cutter head, jamming of the shield) or in the back-up area (e.g., jamming of the back-up equipment, inadmissible convergences of the bored profile, damage to the tunnel support). Depending on the number and the length of the critical stretches, squeezing conditions may even call into question the feasibility of a TBM drive. On account of this, and bearing in mind the steady increase in the number of tunnels excavated with TBMs through so-called ""difficult ground conditions"", the topic investigated in this PhD thesis is of great practical relevance.Based upon case histories reported in the literature, Part I sets out firstly to give an overview of the specific problems of TBM tunnelling under squeezing conditions. Part II presents a computational model which simulates accurately and efficiently the advancing TBM and the installed tunnel support in one single computational step applying the so-called ""steady state method"". Part III advances a number of theory-based decision aids, which will support rapid, initial assessments to be made of thrust force requirements. Part IV investigates the complex problem of the interaction between the advancing TBM, the consolidating ground and the lining. Emphasis is thereby placed on the effect of the gross advance rate and the effect of ground permeability on shield loading during regular TBM operation (the boring process including short standstills) and during a long standstill.","2010","http://books.google.es/books?id=3eJkqtZ2CwcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=122&source=gbs_api","9783728133632",
"Risk Savvy. How To Make Good Decisions","intitle:risk","[Gerd Gigerenzer]","[Self-Help]","A fascinating, practical guide to making better decisions with our money, health and personal lives from Gerd Gigerenzer, the author of Reckoning with Risk. Risk-taking is essential for innovation, fun, and the courage to face the uncertainties in life. Yet for many important decisions, we're often presented with statistics and probabilities that we don't really understand and we inevitably rely on experts in the relevant fields - policy makers, financial advisors, doctors - to analyse and choose for us. But what if they don't quite understand the way the information is presented either? How do we make sure we're asking doctors the right questions about proposed treatment? Is there a rule of thumb that could help choose the right partner? This entertaining book shows us how to recognize when we don't have all the information and know what to do about it. Gerd Gigerenzer looks at examples from every aspect of life to identify the reasons for our collective misunderstanding of the risks we face. He shows how we can all use simple rules to avoid being manipulated into unrealistic fears or hopes, to make better-informed decisions, and to learn to understand risk and uncertainty in our own lives. 'Gigerenzer is brilliant and his topic is fabulous' Steven Pinker 'Catchily optimistic and slyly funny' Guardian Gerd Gigerenzer is Director of the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin and former Professor of Psychology at the University of Chicago.

"Quantifying Systemic Risk","intitle:risk","[Joseph G. Haubrich, Andrew W.

However, there is much debate about how this might be accomplished quantitatively and objectivelyor whether this is even possible. A key issue is determining the appropriate trade-offs between risk and reward from a policy and social welfare perspective given the potential negative impact of crises. One of the first books to address the challenges of measuring statistical risk from a system-wide persepective, Quantifying Systemic Risk looks at the means of measuring systemic risk and explores alternative approaches. Among the topics discussed are the challenges of tying regulations to specific quantitative measures, the effects of learning and adaptation on the evolution of the market, and the distinction between the shocks that start a crisis and the mechanisms that enable it to grow.","2013-01-24","http://books.google.es/books?id=cemEjRqwXFwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=127&source=gbs_api","0226921964",

"Commodity Risk Management. Theory and Application","intitle:risk","[Geoffrey Poitras]","[Business & Economics]","Commodity Risk Management goes beyond just an introductory treatment of derivative securities, dealing with more advanced topics and approaching the subject matter from a unique perspective. At its core lies the concept that commodity risk management decisions require an in-depth understanding of speculative strategies, and vice versa. The book offers readers a unified treatment of important concepts and techniques that are useful in applying derivative securities in the management of risk in commodity markets. While some of these techniques are well known and fairly common, Poitras offers applications to specific situations and links to speculative trading strategies - extensions of the material that not only are hard to come by, but helpful to both the academic and the practitioner. The book is divided into three parts. The first part deals with the general framework for commodity risk management, the second part focuses on the use of derivative security contracts in commodity risk management, and the third part deals with applications to three specific situations. As a textbook, this book is designed to appeal to classes at a senior undergraduate/MBA/MA levelof training in Finance, financial economics, actuarial science, management science, agriculturaleconomics and accounting. There will also be interest for the book as: a monograph for research libraries, a handbook for individuals working in the commodity risk management industry, and a guidebook for those in the general public interested in topics like farm risk management or the assessment of hedging practices of publicly-traded commodity producers.","2013","http://books.google.es/books?id=oqRjVLacgp0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=147&source=gbs_api","9780415879293",

Most traders look at risk in terms of a ""stop-loss"" that enables them to exit a losing trade quickly. In The Risk of Trading, Michael Toma explains that risk is ever-present in every aspect of trading and advocates that traders adopt a more comprehensive view of risk that encompasses the strategic trading plan, account size, drawdowns, maximum possible losses, psychological capital, and crisis management. Shows how to conduct a detailed statistical analysis of an individual's trading methodology through back-testing and real-time results so as to identify when the methodology may be breaking down in actual trading Reveals why traders should think of themselves as project managers who are strategically managing risk The book is based on the author's unique 'focus on the risk' approach to trading using data-driven risk statistical analytics Using this book as a guide, traders can operate more as business managers and learn how to avoid market-busting losses while achieving consistently good results.","2012-04-17","http://books.google.es/books?id=-7kLPl43OBwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=154&source=gbs_api","9781118100837",

"Prophylactic Mastectomy: Insights from Women who Chose to Reduce Their Risk","intitle:risk","[Andrea Patenaude]","[Health & Fitness]","Author Andrea Farkas Patenaude, a clinical psychologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, has spent much time talking with women who decided to have risk-reducing or prophylactic mastectomy rather than undergo a lifetime of repeated screeningsa strategy that can help to detect cancers early, but cannot prevent breast cancer. In Prophylactic Mastectomy: Insights from Women Who Chose to Reduce Their Risk, Patenaude shares many candid stories from these women and documents the risks and benefits of this decision. The potential emotional trauma and lifelong effects on self-concept, body image, and sexual function for those who choose the surgery are profound. While the risks involved are great, these interviews also demonstrate the relief many women find in making this powerful decision. This book supplies much-needed guidance for both patients and physicians in confronting this complex decision, and provides comprehensive information on how women fare emotionally and interpersonally after this life-altering surgery. Interviewed as part of a study funded by the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program and the National Human Genome Research Institute, the subjects are diverse: married and single women, young adults, the middle-aged, parents, and women without children. Every case reveals the ramifications of each individual's difficult but potentially life-saving decision. The women explain why they made their choice, how they adapted to the new look of their bodies, and how they cope with spouses', partners', and family members' reactions to their changed physique.","2012-01-16","http://books.google.es/books?id=fWTH4bcJG40C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=157&source=gbs_api","9780313345173",

Some choices produced positive results, others negative, and a few had mixedeven entirely unexpectedoutcomes.

To achieve this, diverse types of protection barriers are placed as safeguards from the hazard posed by the operation of the system, within a multiple-barrier design concept. These barriers are intended to protect the system from failures of any of its elements, hardware, software, human and organizational. Correspondingly, the quantification of the probability of failure of the system and its protective barriers, through reliability and risk analyses, becomes a primary task in both the system design and operation phases. This exercise book serves as a complementary tool supporting the methodology concepts introduced in the books ""An introduction to the basics of reliability and risk analysis"" and ""Computational methods for reliability and risk analysis"" by Enrico Zio, in that it gives an opportunity to familiarize with the applications of classical and advanced techniques of reliability and risk analysis.

The authors particularly examine the ways that healthy relationships can help teens avoid such common risk behaviors as substance abuse, dating violence, sexual assault, and unsafe sexual practices. Addressing the current lack of effective prevention programs for teens, they present new strategies for encouraging healthy choices. The book first traces differences between the rules of relating for boys and girls and discusses typical and atypical patterns of experimentation in teens. The authors identify the common link among risk behaviors: the relationship connection. In the second part of the book, they examine the principles of successful programs used by schools and communities to cultivate healthy adolescent development. An illuminating conclusion describes the key ingredients for engaging adolescents, their parents, teachers, and communities in the effort to promote healthy, nonviolent relationships among teens.","2008-10-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=JyiZM0mmnVEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=176&source=gbs_api","0300127448",

Particular features of the book include its use of practical examples, coverage of previously unpublished research, and a full review of current risk assessment tools for use with offenders. It is designed with undergraduate courses in mind, providing frequent summaries, lists of further reading, and a glossary. The identification, assessment and management of risk has become a central theme of criminal justice policy. For some penal policy commentators this represents a 'sea-change' in crime management to a new era of 'actuarial justice', that is the management of crime opportunities and risk distribution rather than the management of individual offenders. By drawing on key areas of criminal justice practice such as policing, probation and crime prevention, this book examines the actual extent of this change and reviews the case for a new risk-based penology. The book combines a review of current theories on actuarial justice with a detailed examination of current practices in key frontline agencies. The result is an essential text for criminology students and trainee professionals in criminal justice.","2003-08-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=CSwcFpapUdYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=177&source=gbs_api","9780335206537",

Pereira]","[Nature]","The importance of Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) is increasing due, in part, to recent major disasters throughout the world. CCA and DRR are closely associated and there has been significant awareness at global and national levels to make collective focus on CCA and DRR. Although there are several books on CCA, this is the first systematic academic publication to highlight the linkages between CCA and DRR, CCA-DRR synergy and interactions. The book is divided into four parts: Part 1 focuses on the theory of CCA and DRR and its enabling environment; Part 2 focuses on governance, education and technology as the framework of CCA-DRR linkage; Part 3 focuses on different entry points with chapters on urban, coast, mountain, river and housing; and Part 4 focuses on regional perspective of CCA and DRR looking at developing nations, south Asia, ASEAN and Small Island Developing States. Key issues and challenges related to the CCA and DRR are highlighted throughout, mostly drawing lessons and experiences from the field practices. This book gives researchers and practitioners greater awareness on the current trend of research in the field.","2010","http://books.google.es/books?id=V6QnzMIyHxoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=178&source=gbs_api","9780857244871",

"Americans at Risk. Why We Are Not Prepared for Megadisasters and What We Can Do","intitle:risk","[Irwin Redlener]","[Social Science]","This important book by one of our leading experts on disaster preparedness offers a compelling narrative about our nations inability to properly plan for large-scale disasters and proposes changes that can still be made to assure the safety of its citizens. Five years after 9/11 and one year after Hurricane Katrina, it is painfully clear that the governments emergency response capacity is plagued by incompetence and a paralyzing bureaucracy. Irwin Redlener, who founded and directs the National Center for Disaster Preparedness, brings his years of experience with disasters and health care crises, national and international, to an incisive analysis of why our health care system, our infrastructure, and our overall approach to disaster readiness have left the nation vulnerable, virtually unable to respond effectively to catastrophic events. He has had frank, and sometimes shocking, conversations about the failure of systems during and after disasters with a broad spectrum of peoplefrom hospital workers and FEMA officials to Washington policy makers and military leaders. And he also analyzes the role of nongovernmental organizations, such as the American Red Cross in the aftermath of Katrina. Redlener points out how a government with a track record of over-the-top cronyism and a stunning disregard for accountability has spent billions on random acts of preparedness, with very little to show for itother than an ever-growing bureaucracy. As a doctor, Redlener is especially concerned about Americas increasingly dysfunctional and expensive health care system, incapable of handling a large-scale public health emergency, such as pandemic flu or widespread bioterrorism. And he also looks at the serious problem of a disengaged, uninformed citizenryone of the most important obstacles to assuring optimal readiness for any major crisis. Redlener describes five natural and man-made disaster scenarios as a way to imagine what we might face, what our current systems would and would not prepare us for, and what would constitute optimal planningfor government and the publicin each situation. To see what could be learned from others, he points up some of the more effective ways countries in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East have dealt with various disasters. And he concludes with a real prescription: a nine-point proposal for how America can be better prepared as well as an addendum of what citizens themselves can do. An essential book for our time, Americans at Risk is a devastating and realistic account of where we stand today. From the Hardcover edition.","2006-08-22","http://books.google.es/books?id=yEjLsf2viokC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=186&source=gbs_api","9780307266033",

"Metrics and Methods for Security Risk Management","intitle:risk","[Carl Young]","[Computers]","Not only are corporations and other organizations sometimes targeted by competitors in order to steal their information, they are also targets of political and/or religious groups who understand their economic and symbolic importance. However, a realistic security strategy requires a big-picture approach. At the same time, budgets are decreasing while security departments are dealing with threats that demand greater vigilance. In the wake of the 2008-2009 global economic meltdown, corporate executives are asking difficult questions about effectiveness and efficiency. The need for both information security and physical security is greater today than ever before, and not only to address more complex and dangerous crisis situations, but also to ensure that the methods deployed are proportionate to the risk. The notion of risk is the lens from which all such problems must be viewed. This book identifies and explains these foundational principles, and shows how they directly relate to an assessment of physical security risk. This book provides the modern security professional with a useful reference that facilitates both rigorous thinking and sensible decisions about key strategic choices. * Offers an integrated approach to assessing security risk * Addresses homeland security as well as IT and physical security issues * Describes vital safeguards for ensuring true business continuity","2010-08-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=po0BCKyKp8UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=188&source=gbs_api","9781856179799",
"Risk Management for Computer Security. Protecting Your Network & Information Assets","intitle:risk","[Andy Jones, Debi Ashenden]","[Computers]","The information systems security (InfoSec) profession remains one of the fastest growing professions in the world today. With the advent of the Internet and its use as a method of conducting business, even more emphasis is being placed on InfoSec. However, there is an expanded field of threats that must be addressed by today's InfoSec and information assurance (IA) professionals. Operating within a global business environment with elements of a virtual workforce can create problems not experienced in the past. How do you assess the risk to the organization when information can be accessed, remotely, by employees in the field or while they are traveling internationally? How do you assess the risk to employees who are not working on company premises and are often thousands of miles from the office? How do you assess the risk to your organization and its assets when you have offices or facilities in a nation whose government may be supporting the theft of the corporate ""crown jewels"" in order to assist their own nationally owned or supported corporations? If your risk assessment and management program is to be effective, then these issues must be assessed. Personnel involved in the risk assessment and management process face a much more complex environment today than they have ever encountered before. This book covers more than just the fundamental elements that make up a good risk program. It provides an integrated ""how to"" approach to implementing a corporate program, complete with tested methods and processes; flowcharts; and checklists that can be used by the reader and immediately implemented into a computer and overall corporate security program.

However, little can be said about the macroeconomic factors behind the movements of short- and long-term interest rates as well as the risk compensation demanded by financial investors. By taking on a macro-finance perspective, the books approach explicitly acknowledges the close feedback between monetary policy, the macroeconomy and financial conditions. Both theoretical and empirical models are applied in order to get a profound understanding of the interlinkages between economic activity, the conduct of monetary policy and the underlying macroeconomic factors of bond price movements. Moreover, the book identifies a broad risk-taking channel of monetary transmission which allows a reassessment of the role of financial constraints; it enables policy makers to develop new guidelines for monetary policy and for financial supervision of how to cope with evolving financial imbalances.","2011-08-17","http://books.google.es/books?id=65bTS117JmMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=199&source=gbs_api","9783642215759",

Erikson's Developmental Theory, Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory, and Richard Jessor's Risk Behavior Model were used as frameworks for the study. Based on Cohen G's power analysis (effect size = .30; power = .80) a sample of 132 students were invited to participate in the study. Seventy three students (56%) completed the study; 32 in the control group, 41 in the experimental group. Ingledue's ""Awareness of HPV and Cervical Questionnaire"" was used to assess the students' knowledge levels and behaviors. The education intervention provided information about cervical cancer, HPV and the new prophylactic cervical cancer vaccine. Both groups completed the pretest and the one month posttest; the control group was offered the educational intervention at the time of the one month posttest. The data were analyzed using t-tests, mixed model ANOVAs with repeated measures, and Chi square. Results indicated that there was an increase in knowledge of cervical cancer, HPV and HPV infection in both groups; those in the experimental group reported decreased participation in high-risk sexual behavior practices at the one month posttest. Previous similar studies indicated statistically significant improvement in knowledge and persistent self-reported decrease in health-risk behaviors; this one did not. One possible explanation is different student demographics in the previous studies.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=pr3AZPGkb2gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=201&source=gbs_api","1109114303",

Groundbreaking developments in adolescent brain research underpin this straightforward guide to understandingand dealing withteen behavior. Adolescence has long been characterized as the storm and stress years, and with recent developments in digital communication, it seems todays teens are in for a more complicated journey than ever before. Even the most sympathetic, in-touch parents might throw their hands up in frustration at their teens unpredictable and risky behavior and ask: what are they thinking?! It turns out that teens thrill-seeking activities and quests for independence arent just the result of raging hormones, but rather typical effects of the unique structure and development of the adolescent brain. In easily navigable chapters full of practical anecdotes and examples, acclaimed scientists Aaron White and Scott Swartzwelder draw from the most recent studies on the teen brain to illuminate the complexities of issues such as school, driving, social networking, video games, and mental health in kids whose crucial brain connections are just coming online.","2013-04-22","http://books.google.es/books?id=YtuABan1askC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=205&source=gbs_api","9780393089950",

"More Than Genes: What Science Can Tell Us About Toxic Chemicals, Development, and the Risk to Our Children","intitle:risk","[Dan Agin]","[Medical]","We are all shaped by our genetic inheritance and by the environment we live in. Indeed, the argument about which of these two forces, nature or nurture, predominates has been raging for decades. But what about our very first environment--the prenatal world where we exist for nine months between conception and birth and where we are more vulnerable than at any other point in our lives? In More Than Genes, Dan Agin marshals new scientific evidence to argue that the fetal environment can be just as crucial as genetic hard-wiring or even later environment in determining our intelligence and behavior. Stress during pregnancy, for example, puts women at far greater risk of bearing children prone to anxiety disorders. Nutritional deprivation during early fetal development may elevate the risk of late onset schizophrenia. And exposure to a whole host of environmental toxins--methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, pesticides, ionizing radiation, and most especially lead--as well as maternal use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or cocaine can have impacts ranging from mild cognitive impairment to ADHD, autism, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. Agin argues as well that differences in IQ among racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups are far more attributable to higher levels of stress and chemical toxicity in inner cities--which seep into the prenatal environment and compromise the health of the fetus--than to genetic inheritance. The good news is that the prenatal environment is malleable, and Agin suggests that if we can abandon the naive idea of ""immaculate gestation,"" we can begin to protect fetal development properly. Cogently argued, thoroughly researched, and accessibly written, More Than Genes challenges many long-held assumptions and represents a huge step forward in our understanding of the origins of human intelligence and behavior.","2009-10-03","http://books.google.es/books?id=vZ2xA2tI6JQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=210&source=gbs_api","9780199745807",

"Risk & Adventure in Early Years Outdoor Play. Learning from Forest Schools","intitle:risk","[Sara Knight]","[Education]","Do you want to create exciting outdoor experiences for children? Are you looking for guidance on how to incorporate the wilder and riskier elements of outdoor play into your planning? This book will give you the confidence to offer the children in your setting adventurous and challenging outdoor activities, as well as ways to utilise natural resources to their best advantage. There is clear, practical advice on what you need to do, which is underpinned by the theory that supports the benefits of this approach. Examples from settings are included, to illustrate best practice and to show how things can be achieved. Issues considered include: - being outside in 'bad' weather - the importance of risk-taking - the benefits of rough and tumble play - observing and assessing children in this mode - how these experiences improve children's learning - explaining activities to parents, colleagues and managers - ensuring health and safety requirements are met - the role of the adult in facilitating these experiences. Suitable for all students and practitioners working with young children from Birth to 8 , this book will not only give you ideas for outdoor play but also help you understand exactly what you are doing, why it is educationally sound and developmentally important for children, and where it connects with the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) in England, the Foundation Phase (FP) in Wales and the Curriculum for Excellence in Scotland.

The book is important because the theory is able to explain long term and short term consequences of coalitions; it presents a careful analysis of political party behaviour in India and it combines elements of positive political theory, empirical political science and psychology in explaining coalition behaviour.","1975","http://books.google.es/books?id=O1h9rvWICaMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=223&source=gbs_api","0521208742",

Methods, Tools and Applications","intitle:risk","[Apostolos Papanikolaou]","[Transportation]","Risk-based ship design is a new scientific and engineering field of growing interest to researchers, engineers and professionals from various disciplines related to ship design, construction, operation and regulation. The main motivation to use risk-based approaches is twofold: implement a novel ship design which is considered safe but - for some formal, regulatory reason - cannot be approved today and/or rationally optimise an existing design with respect to safety, without compromising on efficiency and performance. It is a clear direction that all future technological and regulatory (International Maritime Organisation) developments regarding ship design and operation will go through risk-based procedures, which are known and well established in other industries (e.g. nuclear, aviation). The present book derives from the knowledge gained in the course of the project SAFEDOR (Design, Operation and Regulation for Safety), an Integrated Project under the 6th framework programme of the European Commission (IP 516278). The book aims to provide an understanding of the fundamentals and details of the integration of risk-based approaches into the ship design process. The book facilitates the transfer of knowledge from recent research work to the wider maritime community and advances scientific approaches dealing with risk-based design and ship safety.","2009-04-09","http://books.google.es/books?id=s2bPULI9BlYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=228&source=gbs_api","9783540890423",

In line with directives from the EU, the management of risk in the workplace will soon be required by UK regulations. The concept is not new, however; it has already been applied with tangible benefits, as is shown by the case studies drawn from THORP (Cumbria), the Channel Tunnel and motorway bridge maintenance. The book also deals with current research into risk management techniques and with minimizing safety and financial risks, by innovation and the application of life-cycle costing.","1996-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=xOIbIJuX0vcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=247&source=gbs_api","0727720635",

This model, together with its global EFR model, have established proven and practical methodologies to achieve sustainable risk management techniques that are accessible to all organizations. * a practice-oriented guide to risk management issues with examples of how risks are quantified and explains how risk exposure can have a real 'material' financial impact on an organisation * provides best practice examples along with case studies which demonstrate how risks are dealt with by organisations that are rising to the challenge to become more sustainable, financially, socially and environmentally * explains why risk management is a significant tool in enhancing the overall value or performance of any given organisation.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=iHA8ep0wwRQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=249&source=gbs_api","9780750681742",
"Group-Centered Prevention Programs for At-Risk Students","intitle:risk","[Elaine Clanton Harpine]","[Education]","School psychologists, counselors, and educators in the K-12 setting face the daunting responsibility of finding balance between mandated testing, students mental-health concerns, and additional academic help for at-risk students. One solution to this dilemma is to implement a school-based mental health approach that combines learning and counseling needs into a single program. Several types of successful programs are available, though week-long intensive programs have recently increased in popularity.Group-Centered Prevention Programs for At-Risk Students focuses on the development of such a week-long prevention program, and provides professionals with step-by-step directions to create their own program. It also focuses on the use of group-centered interventions as an opportunity to prevent at-risk behaviors as a means of correcting or changing dysfunctional behavior.This highly readable volume addresses such challenging issues as:Using self-reflection to teach writing skills.Increasing interpersonal interaction while honing etiquette.Enhancing group acceptance and reading comprehension.Rebuilding self-efficacy by increasing word recognition and decoding skills.With its solid research foundation combined with clear, practical program descriptions, this volume is an essential addition to the libraries of researchers and practitioners alike in the disciplines of school psychology, education, social work, psychotherapy and counseling, and clinical child psychology.","2010-11-09","http://books.google.es/books?id=Bi93GlH-NooC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=250&source=gbs_api","144197248X",

Farrington Professor of Psychological Criminology, Department of Criminal Justice University of Massachusetts Brandon C. Welsh Assistant Professor, Lowell]","[Social Science]","After decades of rigorous study in the United States and across the Western world, a great deal is known about the early risk factors for offending. High impulsiveness, low attainment, criminal parents, parental conflict, and growing up in a deprived, high-crime neighborhood are among the most important factors. There is also a growing body of high quality scientific evidence on the effectiveness of early prevention programs designed to prevent children from embarking on a life of crime. Drawing on the latest evidence, Saving Children from a Life of Crime is the first book to assess the early causes of offending and what works best to prevent it. Preschool intellectual enrichment, child skills training, parent management training, and home visiting programs are among the most effective early prevention programs. Criminologists David Farrington and Brandon Welsh also outline a policy strategy--early prevention--that uses this current research knowledge and brings into sharper focus what America's national crime fighting priority ought to be. At a time when unacceptable crime levels in America, rising criminal justice costs, and a punitive crime policy have spurred a growing interest in the early prevention of delinquency, Farrington and Welsh here lay the groundwork for change with a comprehensive national prevention strategy to save children from a life of crime.","2006-10-25","http://books.google.es/books?id=UfYKaSjW9aIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=251&source=gbs_api","9780199702527",

Did Eliska's motives for latching on to Roger get him killed? Or did some of her shadowy and dangerous little friends take care of the job? And why were there boxes and boxes of Christmas ornaments in the dead mans apartment?

"Game Theoretic Risk Analysis of Security Threats","intitle:risk","[Vicki M. Bier, M. Naceur Azaiez]","[Mathematics]","Game Theoretic Risk Analysis of Security Threats introduces reliability and risk analysis in the face of threats by intelligent agents. More specifically, game-theoretic models will be developed for identifying optimal and/or equilibrium defense and attack strategies in systems of varying degrees of complexity. The book covers applications to networks, including problems in both telecommunications and transportation. However, the book's primary focus is to integrate game theory and reliability methodologies into unified techniques to predict, detect, diminish, and stop intentional attacks at targets that vary in complexity. In this book, leading researchers combine reliability and risk analysis with game theory methods to create a set of functional tools that can be used by security personnel to offset intentional, intelligent threats (including the threats of terrorism and war). This means a comprehensive treatment of such problems must consider two aspects: (1) the structure of the system to be protected and (2) the adaptive nature of the threat (that is, beyond the static nature of the threat). The book provides a set of scientific tools for analyzing and applying game-theoretic reliability problems in the presence of intentional, intelligent threats. These scientific tools address problems of global safety and create more cost-effective defensive investments.","2008-10-20","http://books.google.es/books?id=659orlQB-8sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=253&source=gbs_api","9780387877679",

They argue that the tools, technologies, and practices used to measure risk to the individual have gone unquestioned and unstudied and that current methods of risk assessment may be distorting the principles of social justice. Central to this study is an examination of the everyday experiences of workers and parents engaged in risk assessment processes in Canadian child welfare investigations. Going beyond theory, Swift and Callahan highlight how risk evaluations play out in actual interactions with vulnerable people. Pointing out that standardized risk assessment tools do not take factors such as class, race, gender, and culture into account, At Risk raises important questions about the viability of risk management plans that are not tailored to individual situations.","2009","http://books.google.es/books?id=Z7LdhtXtw80C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=255&source=gbs_api","9780802094995",

This book builds a unifying scientific framework for discussing and evaluating the quality of risk assessments and whether they are fit for purpose. Uncertainty is a central topic. In practice, uncertainties about inputs are rarely reflected in assessments, with the result that many safety measures are considered unjustified. Other topics include the meaning of a probability, the use of probability models, the use of Bayesian ideas and techniques, and the use of risk assessment in a practical decision-making context. Written for professionals, as well as graduate students and researchers, the book assumes basic probability, statistics and risk assessment methods. Examples make concepts concrete, and three extended case studies show the scientific framework in action.","2011-03-03","http://books.google.es/books?id=4BPuarryFt4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=257&source=gbs_api","9781139496438",

"Food Safety Assurance and Veterinary Public Health: Risk management strategies : monitoring and surveillance","intitle:risk","[Frans J. M. Smulders, John Daniel Collins]","[Technology & Engineering]","For the veterinarian, monitoring and surveillance represent the best means of ensuring sustainable animal production at a time when consumer demands reflect awareness that many of the hazards associated with food animal production can be minimised or avoided through proper management at the primary production level. Preventive medicine and quality and safety assurance programmes are primarily based on knowledge of the existing strengths and weaknesses of the clients' enterprise and their ability to enact effective intervention measures. Accordingly, the food animal veterinarian relies upon effective monitoring of current performance and herd health status both for the purpose of maximising efficiency of production and providing an assurance that the primary food product meets required health standards in terms of freedom from those agents of concern that have their origin on the farm. These agents include foodborne parasites, pathogenic bacteria, some of which display a resistance to antimicrobial agents, contaminants of environmental origin, as well as chemical and pharmaceutical residues. The more successful these hazards are addressed at the farm, the better the quality and safety of the final product and their marketing possibilities will be. Communication between the primary producer and the food processing industry that facilitates real-time exchange of information on these issues is essential for the practice of preventive medicine at the herd and flock level. Integrated food chain quality and safety control programmes, when linked to such monitoring and surveillance principles in regard to both human and animal health, represent the means of achieving sustainable food animal production on a global scale, in line with the conclusions of WTO and EU. Volume 3 of the ""Food Safety Assurance and Veterinary Public Health"" series addresses this collaborative approach. Leading international experts from academia, industry and governmental institutions have been identified to deal with the various aspects of this collaborative approach in monitoring and surveillance.","2005","http://books.google.es/books?id=pYqTqQJHi8sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=283&source=gbs_api","9789076998077",

However, the association between bodybuilding, drugs and risk has contributed to a negative image of an activity which many people find puzzling. Using data obtained from participant observation and interviews, this book explores bodybuilding subculture from the perspective of the bodybuilder. It looks at: * How bodybuilders try to maintain competent social identities * How they manage the risks of using steroids and other physique-enhancing drugs * How they understand the alleged steroid-violence link * How they 'see' the muscular body. Through systematic exploration it becomes apparent that previous attempts to explain bodybuilding in terms of 'masculinity-in-crisis' or gender insecurity are open to question.

"The Welfare State as Piggy Bank: Information, Risk, Uncertainty, and the Role of the State","intitle:risk","[Nicholas Barr]","[Business & Economics]","Of the many functions of the welfare state, two are particularly prominent: the 'Robin Hood' function - the provision of poverty relief, the redistribution of income and wealth, and the reduction of social exclusion; and the 'piggy bank' function - ensuring mechanisms for insurance and for redistribution over the life cycle. The piggy-bank function, unlike the redistributive purpose of the welfare state, has received relatively little attention, and is not widely understood. This book redresses the balance. Nicholas Barr's central contention is that---contrary to popular opinion---the welfare state exists for reasons additional to poverty relief. These reasons - encapsulated by the piggy-bank function - arise out of pervasive problems of imperfect information, risk, and uncertainty. Even if all poverty and social exclusion could be eradicated, people would still need to insure themselves and to redistribute over the life cycle. As a result, Barr argues, the welfare state is here to stay, since twenty-first century developments do nothing to undermine these reasons. He also explores ways in which the welfare state can and will adapt to economic and social change, including specific, and sometimes novel, solutions. The analysis in ""The Welfare State as Piggy Bank"" is international, applying to advanced industrial countries, as well as addressing post-communist countries, and touching upon middle-income developing countries. Barr's approach is contemporary and forward-thinking. His discussion ranges over a number of topics of central relevance to life in the twenty-first century, including genetic screening and its impact on insurance; the convergence of private and social insurance; how to finance long-term care; pension reform in the light of fluid family structures and a mobile workforce; loans for financing investment in human capital; and new ways of involving private finance in tertiary education.","2001-05-10","http://books.google.es/books?id=WkDa5JDEqMQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=303&source=gbs_api","9780191608278",

"Financial Risk Forecasting. The Theory and Practice of Forecasting Market Risk with Implementation in R and Matlab","intitle:risk","[Jon Danielsson]","[Business & Economics]","Financial Risk Forecasting is a complete introduction to practical quantitative risk management, with a focus on market risk. Derived from the authors teaching notes and years spent training practitioners in risk management techniques, it brings together the three key disciplines of finance, statistics and modeling (programming), to provide a thorough grounding in risk management techniques. Written by renowned risk expert Jon Danielsson, the book begins with an introduction to financial markets and market prices, volatility clusters, fat tails and nonlinear dependence. It then goes on to present volatility forecasting with both univatiate and multivatiate methods, discussing the various methods used by industry, with a special focus on the GARCH family of models. The evaluation of the quality of forecasts is discussed in detail. Next, the main concepts in risk and models to forecast risk are discussed, especially volatility, value-at-risk and expected shortfall. The focus is both on risk in basic assets such as stocks and foreign exchange, but also calculations of risk in bonds and options, with analytical methods such as delta-normal VaR and duration-normal VaR and Monte Carlo simulation. The book then moves on to the evaluation of risk models with methods like backtesting, followed by a discussion on stress testing. The book concludes by focussing on the forecasting of risk in very large and uncommon events with extreme value theory and considering the underlying assumptions behind almost every risk model in practical use  that risk is exogenous  and what happens when those assumptions are violated. Every method presented brings together theoretical discussion and derivation of key equations and a discussion of issues in practical implementation. Each method is implemented in both MATLAB and R, two of the most commonly used mathematical programming languages for risk forecasting with which the reader can implement the models illustrated in the book. The book includes four appendices. The first introduces basic concepts in statistics and financial time series referred to throughout the book.

"Managing Risk. The Human Element","intitle:risk","[Romney Beecher Duffey, John Walton Saull]","[Computers]","The human element is the principle cause of incidents and accidents in all technology industries; hence it is evident that an understanding of the interaction between humans and technology is crucial to the effective management of risk. Despite this, no tested model that explicitly and quantitatively includes the human element in risk prediction is currently available. Managing Risk: the Human Element combines descriptive and explanatory text with theoretical and mathematical analysis, offering important new concepts that can be used to improve the management of risk, trend analysis and prediction, and hence affect the accident rate in technological industries. It uses examples of major accidents to identify common causal factors, or echoes, and argues that the use of specific experience parameters for each particular industry is vital to achieving a minimum error rate as defined by mathematical prediction. New ideas for the perception, calculation and prediction of risk are introduced, and safety management is covered in depth, including for rare events and unknown outcomes Discusses applications to multiple industries including nuclear, aviation, medical, shipping, chemical, industrial, railway, offshore oil and gas; Shows consistency between learning for large systems and technologies with the psychological models of learning from error correction at the personal level; Offers the expertise of key leading industry figures involved in safety work in the civil aviation and nuclear engineering industries; Incorporates numerous fascinating case studies of key technological accidents. Managing Risk: the Human Element is an essential read for professional safety experts, human reliability experts and engineers in all technological industries, as well as risk analysts, corporate managers and statistical analysts. It is also of interest to professors, researchers and postgraduate students of reliability and safety engineering, and to experts in human performance. congratulations on what appears to be, at a high level of review, a significant contribution to the literatureI have found much to be admired in (your) research Mr. Joseph Fragola  Vice President of Valador Inc. The book is not only technically informative, but also attractive to all concerned readers and easy to be comprehended at various level of educational background. It is truly an excellent book ever written for the safety risk managers and analysis professionals in the engineering community, especially in the high reliability organizations Dr Feng Hsu, Head of Risk Assessment and Management, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center I admire your courage in confronting your theoretical ideas with such diverse, ecologically valid data, and your success in capturing a major trend in them.I should add that I find all this quite inspiring . The idea that you need to find the right measure of accumulated experience and not just routinely used calendar time makes so much sense that it comes as a shock to realize that this is a new idea, Professor Stellan Ohlsson, Professor of Psychology, University of Illinois at Chicago","2008-09-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=QN-IN7xBPWAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=308&source=gbs_api","9780470714454",

"Value at Risk and Bank Capital Management. Risk Adjusted Performances, Capital Management and Capital Allocation Decision Making","intitle:risk","[Francesco Saita]","[Business & Economics]","While the highly technical measurement techniques and methodologies of Value at Risk have attracted huge interest, much less attention has been focused on how Value at Risk and the risk-adjusted performance measures such as RAROC or economic profit/EVA· can be effectively used to improve a bank¡¦s decision making processes. Academic books are typically concerned primarily with measurement techniques, and devote only a small section to describing the applications, usually without discussing the problems that changing organizational processes in banks may have on business units¡¦ behaviour. Practitioners¡¦ books are often based on a single experience, presenting the approach that has been pursued by a single bank, but often do not adequately evaluate that approach. In actual practice, the choice of how to use Value at Risk and risk-adjusted performance measures has no single optimal solution, but requires effective decision making that can identify the solution that is consistent with the bank¡¦s style of management and coordination mechanisms, and often with characteristics of individual business units as well. In this book, Francesco Saita of Bocconi University argues that even though risk measurement techniques have greatly improved in recent years for market, credit and now also operational risk, capital management and capital allocation decisions are far from becoming purely technical and mechanical. On one hand, decisions about capital management must consider handling different capital constraints (e.g. regulatory vs. economic capital ) and face remarkable difficulties in providing a measure of ¡§aggregated¡ ? Value at Risk (i.e. a measure that considers the overall value at risk of the bank after diversification across risk types). On the other hand, the aim of using capital more efficiently through capital allocation cannot be achieved only through a sort of centralized asset allocation process, but rather by designing a Value at Risk limit system and a risk-adjusted performance measurement system that are designed to provide the right incentives to individual business units. This connection between sophisticated and cutting edge risk measurement techniques and practical bank decision making about capital management and capital allocation make this book unique and provide readers with a depth of academic and theoretical expertise combined with practical and real-world understanding of bank structure, organizational constraints, and decisionmaking processes. *Contains concise, expert analysis of the latest technical VaR measures but without the highly mathematical component of other books *Discusses practical applications of these measures in the real world of banking, focusing on effective decision making for capital management and allocation *Author is based at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy, one of the foremost institutions for banking in Europe","2010-07-26","http://books.google.es/books?id=EHrEDrlpcqcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=310&source=gbs_api","9780080471068",

"Reliability and Risk. A Bayesian Perspective","intitle:risk","[Nozer D. Singpurwalla]","[Mathematics]","We all like to know how reliable and how risky certain situations are, and our increasing reliance on technology has led to the need for more precise assessments than ever before. Such precision has resulted in efforts both to sharpen the notions of risk and reliability, and to quantify them. Quantification is required for normative decision-making, especially decisions pertaining to our safety and wellbeing. Increasingly in recent years Bayesian methods have become key to such quantifications. Reliability and Risk provides a comprehensive overview of the mathematical and statistical aspects of risk and reliability analysis, from a Bayesian perspective. This book sets out to change the way in which we think about reliability and survival analysis by casting them in the broader context of decision-making. This is achieved by: Providing a broad coverage of the diverse aspects of reliability, including: multivariate failure models, dynamic reliability, event history analysis, non-parametric Bayes, competing risks, co-operative and competing systems, and signature analysis. Covering the essentials of Bayesian statistics and exchangeability, enabling readers who are unfamiliar with Bayesian inference to benefit from the book. Introducing the notion of composite reliability, or the collective reliability of a population of items. Discussing the relationship between notions of reliability and survival analysis and econometrics and financial risk. Reliability and Risk can most profitably be used by practitioners and research workers in reliability and survivability as a source of information, reference, and open problems. It can also form the basis of a graduate level course in reliability and risk analysis for students in statistics, biostatistics, engineering (industrial, nuclear, systems), operations research, and other mathematically oriented scientists, wherein the instructor could supplement the material with examples and problems.","2006-08-14","http://books.google.es/books?id=szLqBTXsyJQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=316&source=gbs_api","9780470060339",

They then proceed to develop a new residential mortgage lending system that can fix our broken markets because it addresses the root causes. The most impressive attributes of their new system is its commonsense return to the basics of traditional underwriting, combined with factors based on expert judgment and statistics and forward-looking attributes, all of which can be updated as markets change. The whole process is transparent to the borrower, lender, and investor."" Dean Schultz, President and CEO, Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco ""The credit market crisis of 2008 has deeply affected the economic lives of every American. Yet, its underlying causes and its surface features are so complex that many observers and even policymakers barely understand them. This timely book will help guide nonspecialists through the workings of financial markets, particularly how they value, price, and distribute risk."" Professor William Greene, Stern School of Business, New York University ""This book is a well-timed departure from much of what is being written today regarding the current foreclosure and credit crisis. Rather than attempting to blame lenders, borrowers, and/or federal regulators for the mortgage meltdown and the subsequent impacts on the financial markets, Clark and Mingyuan have proposed a groundbreaking new framework to revolutionize our current lending system. The book is built on the authors' deep understanding of risk and the models used for credit analysis, and reflects their commitment to solve the problem. What I find most profound is their passion to develop a system that will facilitate new and better investment, especially in underserved urban markets that have been disproportionately impacted in the current crisis. I applaud the authors for this important work, and urge practitioners and theorists alike to investigate this new approach."" John Talmage, President and CEO, Social Compact ""In the wake of the credit crisis, it is clear that transparency is the key to not repeating history.

Measuring Risk Aversion show that a substantial part of this variation is due to the differences in the outcome variables used in the analysis. Measuring Risk Aversion provides a detailed discussion of the adjustment of risk references and how to go about making such adjustments to a common scale.

"Risk and Resilience in U.S. Military Families","intitle:risk","[Shelley MacDermid Wadsworth, David S. Riggs]","[Family & Relationships]","War related separations challenge military families in many ways. The worry and uncertainty associated with absent family members exacerbates the challenges of personal, social, and economic resources on the home front. U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have sent a million service personnel from the U.S. alone into conflict areas leaving millions of spouses, children and others in stressful circumstances. This is not a new situation for military families, but it has taken a toll of magnified proportions in recent times. In addition, medical advances have prolonged the life of those who might have died of injuries. As a result, more families are caring for those who have experienced amputation, traumatic brain injury, and profound psychological wounds. The Department of Defence has launched unprecedented efforts to support service members and families before, during, and after deployment in all locations of the country as well as in remote locations. Stress in U.S. Military Families brings together an interdisciplinary group of experts from the military to the medical to examine the issues of this critical problem. Its goal is to review the factors that contribute to stress in military families and to point toward strategies and policies that can help. Covering the major topics of parenting, marital functioning, and the stress of medical care, and including a special chapter on single service members, it serves as a comprehensive guide for those who will intervene in these problems and for those undertaking their research.","2010-11-03","http://books.google.es/books?id=I5U0w32z_KYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=340&source=gbs_api","1441970649",

As Christopher Slobogin explains in Privacy at Risk, these intrusive acts of surveillance are subject to very little regulation. Applying the Fourth Amendments prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures, Slobogin argues that courts should prod legislatures into enacting more meaningful protection against government overreaching. In setting forth a comprehensive framework meant to preserve rights guaranteed by the Constitution without compromising the governments ability to investigate criminal acts, Slobogin offers a balanced regulatory regime that should intrigue everyone concerned about privacy rights in the digital age.","2008-09-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=ObzWmzVyMnwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=344&source=gbs_api","9780226762944",

"DISASTER RISK REDUCTION IN SOUTH ASIA","intitle:risk","[PARDEEP SAHNI, MADHAVI MALALGODA ARIYABANDU]","[Social Science]","South Asia represents a region highly prone to natural disasters. Disasters not only disrupt the normal life of the affected communities and the countries but also impede developmental efforts. By and large, the approach of the major stakeholders has been 'reactive' rather than 'proactive'. There is indeed, a dire need for concerted and well-planned efforts to achieve risk reduction through risk identification, and sharing and transfer of information. This edited volume explores how the risk of disasters can be reduced by structural and non-structural measures with detailed, comprehensive and participatory strategies. Twenty-seven contributors, both academicians and practitioners, investigate the challenges that the region faces and how changes can be effected at the community, society, government and non-government levels to foster a culture of preparedness. The overall focus is on risk reduction through prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction. Some case studies from different settings dealing with various disasters have also been included. Since disaster risk reduction is an area of great concern and there is absolute dearth of literature addressing this issue with regard to South Asia, this volume will be of immense utility and interest to government departments, NGOs, insurance companies, universities, training institutions, professional associates, media, general public, and students pursuing courses in disaster management.","2003-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=R2TCvIPn_dAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=346&source=gbs_api","9788120322004",
"Managing Downside Risk in Financial Markets","intitle:risk","[Frank A. Sortino, Stephen Satchell]","[Business & Economics]","Quantitative methods have revolutionized the area of trading, regulation, risk management, portfolio construction, asset pricing and treasury activities, and governmental activity such as central banking to name but some of the applications. Downside-risk, as a quantitative method, is an accurate measurement of investment risk, because it captures the risk of not accomplishing the investor's goal. 'Downside Risk in Financial Markets' demonstrates how downside-risk can produce better results in performance measurement and asset allocation than variance modelling. Theory, as well as the practical issues involved in its implementation, is covered and the arguments put forward emphatically show the superiority of downside risk models to variance models in terms of risk measurement and decision making. Variance considers all uncertainty to be risky. Downside-risk only considers returns below that needed to accomplish the investor's goal, to be risky. Risk is one of the biggest issues facing the financial markets today. 'Downside Risk in Financial Markets' outlines the major issues for Investment Managers and focuses on ""downside-risk"" as a key activity in managing risk in investment/portfolio management. Managing risk is now THE paramount topic within the financial sector and recurring losses through the 1990s has shocked financial institutions into placing much greater emphasis on risk management and control. Free Software Enclosed To help you implement the knowledge you will gain from reading this book, a CD is enclosed that contains free software programs that were previously only available to institutional investors under special licensing agreement to The pension Research Institute. This is our contribution to the advancement of professionalism in portfolio management. The Forsey-Sortino model is an executable program that: 1. Runs on any PC without the need of any additional software. 2. Uses the bootstrap procedure developed by Dr. Bradley Effron at Stanford University to uncover what could have happened, instead of relying only on what did happen in the past. This is the best procedure we know of for describing the nature of uncertainty in financial markets. 3. Fits a three parameter lognormal distribution to the bootstrapped data to allow downside risk to be calculated from a continuous distribution. This improves the efficacy of the downside risk estimates. 4. Calculates upside potential and downside risk from monthly returns on any portfolio manager. 5. Calculates upside potential and downside risk from any user defined distribution. Forsey-Sortino Source Code: 1. The source code, written in Visual Basic 5.0, is provided for institutional investors who want to add these calculations to their existing financial services. 2. No royalties are required for this source code, providing institutions inform clients of the source of these calculations. A growing number of services are now calculating downside risk in a manner that we are not comfortable with. Therefore, we want investors to know when downside risk and upside potential are calculated in accordance with the methodology described in this book. Riddles Spreadsheet: 1.

"Introduction to Risk Parity and Budgeting","intitle:risk","[Thierry Roncalli]","[Business & Economics]","Although portfolio management didnt change much during the 40 years after the seminal works of Markowitz and Sharpe, the development of risk budgeting techniques marked an important milestone in the deepening of the relationship between risk and asset management. Risk parity then became a popular financial model of investment after the global financial crisis in 2008. Today, pension funds and institutional investors are using this approach in the development of smart indexing and the redefinition of long-term investment policies. Written by a well-known expert of asset management and risk parity, Introduction to Risk Parity and Budgeting provides an up-to-date treatment of this alternative method to Markowitz optimization. It builds financial exposure to equities and commodities, considers credit risk in the management of bond portfolios, and designs long-term investment policy. The first part of the book gives a theoretical account of portfolio optimization and risk parity. The author discusses modern portfolio theory and offers a comprehensive guide to risk budgeting. Each chapter in the second part presents an application of risk parity to a specific asset class. The text covers risk-based equity indexation (also called smart beta) and shows how to use risk budgeting techniques to manage bond portfolios. It also explores alternative investments, such as commodities and hedge funds, and applies risk parity techniques to multi-asset classes. The books first appendix provides technical materials on optimization problems, copula functions, and dynamic asset allocation. The second appendix contains 30 tutorial exercises. Solutions to the exercises, slides for instructors, and Gauss computer programs to reproduce the books examples, tables, and figures are available on the authors website.","2013-07-16","http://books.google.es/books?id=cyTpc6aflgQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=354&source=gbs_api","9781482207156",

"Deviance and Risk on Holiday.

In contrast to existing knowledge and populist depictions, Briggs argues that the root of these behaviours is not pathological but rather it is more about how this social group have come to self validate what is expected of them in their leisure time and, as a consequence, how their attitudes are subtly guided and endorsed by the commodified social context of resorts which are only interested in making money at their expense.

"Reforms at Risk. What Happens After Major Policy Changes Are Enacted","intitle:risk","[Eric M. Patashnik]","[Political Science]","Reforms at Risk is the first book to closely examine what happens to sweeping and seemingly successful policy reforms after they are passed. Most books focus on the politics of reform adoption, yet as Eric Patashnik shows here, the political struggle does not end when major reforms become enacted. Why do certain highly praised policy reforms endure while others are quietly reversed or eroded away? Patashnik peers into some of the most critical arenas of domestic-policy reform--including taxes, agricultural subsidies, airline deregulation, emissions trading, welfare state reform, and reform of government procurement--to identify the factors that enable reform measures to survive. He argues that the reforms that stick destroy an existing policy subsystem and reconfigure the political dynamic. Patashnik demonstrates that sustainable reforms create positive policy feedbacks, transform institutions, and often unleash the ''creative destructiveness'' of market forces. Reforms at Risk debunks the argument that reforms inevitably fail because Congress is prey to special interests, and the book provides a more realistic portrait of the possibilities and limits of positive change in American government. It is essential reading for scholars and practitioners of U.S. politics and public policy, offering practical lessons for anyone who wants to ensure that hard-fought reform victories survive.","2014-04-24","http://books.google.es/books?id=fLA4YmFH-rcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=362&source=gbs_api","1400828856",

"A New Market Risk Model for Cogeneration Project Financing---combined Heat and Power Development Without a Power Purchase Agreement","intitle:risk","[Timothy A. Lockwood]",,"Federal legislative changes in 2006 no longer entitle cogeneration project financings by law to receive the benefit of a power purchase agreement underwritten by an investment-grade investor-owned utility. Consequently, this research explored the need for a new market-risk model for future cogeneration and combined heat and power (CHP) project financing. CHP project investment represents a potentially enormous energy efficiency benefit through its application by reducing fossil fuel use up to 55% when compared to traditional energy generation, and concurrently eliminates constituent air emissions up to 50%, including global warming gases. As a supplemental approach to a comprehensive technical analysis, a quantitative multivariate modeling was also used to test the statistical validity and reliability of host facility energy demand and CHP supply ratios in predicting the economic performance of CHP project financing. The resulting analytical models, although not statistically reliable at this time, suggest a radically simplified CHP design method for future profitable CHP investments using four easily attainable energy ratios. This design method shows that financially successful CHP adoption occurs when the average system heat-to-power-ratio supply is less than or equal to the average host-convertible-energy-ratio, and when the average nominally-rated capacity is less than average host facility-load-factor demands. New CHP investments can play a role in solving the world-wide problem of accommodating growing energy demand while preserving our precious and irreplaceable air quality for future generations.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=ZlCM0zAv7VsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=365&source=gbs_api","0549449477",

"Children at Risk. The Precarious State of Children's Well-Being in America","intitle:risk","[Janice Shaw Crouse]","[Social Science]","The desire for our children to be free from want and danger and to be able to enjoy their youth in innocence would seem to be universal. Conventional wisdom says that parents in every socio-economic level of society share the dream of preserving their children's innocence. All want to provide a childhood and adolescence that shelters and protects children from the harshness of life and nurtures them until they are able to withstand the onslaught of reality. One need only look at troubled areas of the world, such as Northern Ireland, parts of the Middle East, or any number of other points on the globe, to see how weak is any communion forged out of these universal desires for the welfare of children. Even in the United States, the competition of ideas and values about what represents the ""good"" society in which to raise our children is fierce-as are differing views about the value of innocence and even life itself. These differing ideas and values affect people's actions even when they have never reflected on them, or have never cared enough to formulate those values into a coherent worldview. Crouse contends that without morals, children are at risk. Moral boundaries, not moral relativism, provide a safe haven for children by preserving their innocence and protecting them from predators and pedophiles. When authentic religious faith has been quashed, children are no longer safe. When the underlying values are wrong, when there are no common values unifying a people, even the best programs and most honorable of intentions are doomed to failure. Well-intentioned programs and policies inevitably fail miserably without an undergirding moral foundation, as is documented by an abundance of data and the social trends in America today.","2011-12-31","http://books.google.es/books?id=OrVycYAb-U0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=368&source=gbs_api","1412815193",

"Quantitative Risk Management. Concepts, Techniques, and Tools","intitle:risk","[Alexander J. McNeil, Rüdiger Frey, Paul Embrechts]","[Business & Economics]","The implementation of sound quantitative risk models is a vital concern for all financial institutions, and this trend has accelerated in recent years with regulatory processes such as Basel II. This book provides a comprehensive treatment of the theoretical concepts and modelling techniques of quantitative risk management and equips readers--whether financial risk analysts, actuaries, regulators, or students of quantitative finance--with practical tools to solve real-world problems. The authors cover methods for market, credit, and operational risk modelling; place standard industry approaches on a more formal footing; and describe recent developments that go beyond, and address main deficiencies of, current practice. The book's methodology draws on diverse quantitative disciplines, from mathematical finance through statistics and econometrics to actuarial mathematics. Main concepts discussed include loss distributions, risk measures, and risk aggregation and allocation principles. A main theme is the need to satisfactorily address extreme outcomes and the dependence of key risk drivers. The techniques required derive from multivariate statistical analysis, financial time series modelling, copulas, and extreme value theory. A more technical chapter addresses credit derivatives. Based on courses taught to masters students and professionals, this book is a unique and fundamental reference that is set to become a standard in the field.","2005-09-26","http://books.google.es/books?id=f5J_OZPeq50C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=370&source=gbs_api","0691122555",

Tannenbaum, provides a critical review of current practices in the ecological risk assessment field and proposes alternatives that are supported by established science and keen observation. It is hoped that this approach will pave the way to a greater understanding of what appropriate and useful ecological assessment for contaminated sites should entail. He demonstrates that in most cases current practices do not provide for an assessment of ecological risk, and moreover, that endeavoring to assess ecological risk is actually an unnecessary undertaking at conventional hazardous waste sites. (He states, for example, that the concept of scale is often ignored by practitioners, questions why animals like deer are routinely assessed at 5-acre sites, and challenges the ecotoxicology data currently used.) The book is aimed at students and professionals in the fields of environmental science, ecology, ecotoxicology, and health risk assessment.","2013-09-10","http://books.google.es/books?id=vYXHAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=377&source=gbs_api","9781118743621",

"Risk Management for Water and Wastewater Utilities","intitle:risk","[Simon Pollard]","[Science]","The provision of safe drinking water and the protection of public health and the environment through the treatment of wastewaters is increasingly informed by risk-based decision-making. Aspects of utility management such as process design and optimisation, asset management and compliance monitoring rely on a mature understanding of process risk within a broader context of business and environmental risk management. For operators, risk management is now regarded as a key business function. Understanding risk and being able to implement risk management is critical to the provision of safe drinking water. As part of a move towards a more strategic, forward looking approach to utility management, the IWA is promoting a risk-based approach to water utility management, from catchment to tap, through the implementation of the Bonn Charter (2004). *Why manage risk? *Basic probability and statistics *Process risk and reliability analysis *Assessing risks beyond the unit process boundary *Regulating water utility risks *Business risk management for water and wastewater utilities *Managing opportunity and reputational risk *Embedding better decision-making within utilities Having provided rationale for the importance of risk management, the text begins with the familiar territory of unit processes and process reliability.

"Managing Environmental Risk Through Insurance","intitle:risk","[Paul K. Freeman, Howard Kunreuther]","[Business & Economics]","Can insurance be used as a means to obtain compliance with environmental policy? Answering this question requires examination of a broad mosaic of academic issues, including current systems available for providing compensation and deterrence, use of contracts (including insurance) as substitutes for tort law, limitations of regulatory policy-making by government agencies, pre-conditions for creation of insurance products, and market mechanisms necessary for insurance to be purchased or sold. The purpose of Managing Environmental Risk Through Insurance is to highlight the potential role that insurance and performance standards can play in managing environmental risk. Insurance can play a significant role in dealing with one of the most problematic issues facing society today - how to compensate for environmental exposures. This book analyzes the ability of insurance to play a role in managing environmental risk. It begins by outlining the role insurance plays in society in contrast to other societal tools for addressing risk: government benefit programs and imposition of involuntary liability using the court system. By so doing, the book describes the comparative advantages of insurance. The book then analyzes the insurability of the risks. Finally, the book applies the insurability analysis to three concrete environmental examples.","1997-06-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=js8El6E1SQwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=381&source=gbs_api","0792399013",

"Risk and Misfortune. A Social Construction of Accidents","intitle:risk","[Judith Green]","[Social Science]","There has been a growing sociological interest in both risk and its management, and with how we cope with the uncertainties of late 20th- century life. Understanding accidents is the key to understanding the risk society, for accidents are both the paradigmatic challenge for risk technologies to predict the apparently unpredictable and the ultimate indicator of the limits of those technologies.; The book traces the emergence of the ""accident"" as a marginal misfortune in modernist thought, and its transformation into a ""preventable"" misfortune in the late 20th century. It identifies accidents as being crucial to self- conscious, rational modernity in the early 20th century: accidents which ""just happen"" marked the limits of rational explanation and only the irrational denied their existence. However, as an examination of Contemporary Medical And Health Promotion Writing Shows, The Accident should no longer happen. The rise of risk assessment constructs the accident as an essentially preventable misfortune.; This book should be of interest to students and sociologists working in the areas of social theory, risk, health and illness, and knowledge. It should also be of interest to those concerned about cultural change in the late 20th century, and the implications of risk assessment technologies.","1997-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=c4b5JU8spggC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=385&source=gbs_api","1857285611",

Recognizing and identifying prospective events of terrorism against the water infrastructure is critical to the protection of the nation, as the consequences triggered by a terrorist attack on the water supply would be devastating. Risk Assessment for Water Infrastructure: Safety and Security provides a unique quantitative risk assessment methodology for protection and security against terrorist contamination, vandalism, attacks against dams, and other threats to water supply systems. Focusing on the human safety, environmental, and economic consequences triggered by potential terrorist attacks and other threats, the book presents: The development of an integrated approach of risk assessment based upon the cumulative prospect theory The qualitative/quantitative processes and models for security and safe facility operations as required by EPA, DHS, and other governmental and regulatory agencies The application of an integrated model to the risk assessment of surface water, dams, wells, wastewater treatment facilities, reservoirs, and aqueducts of large urban regions The development of intelligence analysis incorporating risk assessment for terrorism prevention Finally, the book presents the legal and regulatory requirements and policy related to the protection and security of water infrastructure from terrorism and natural hazards to both human health and the environment. By analyzing potential terrorist risks against the water supply, strategic improvements in U.S. water infrastructure security may be achieved, including changes in policy, incorporation of intrusion detection technology, increased surveillance, and increased intelligence.

This second edition is packed with information reflecting advances in this evolving methodology, and includes worked examples on a CD-ROM. CPQRA is used to identify incident scenarios and evaluate their risk by defining the probability of failure, the various consequences and the potential impact of those consequences. It is an invaluable methodology to evaluate these when qualitative analysis cannot provide adequate understanding and when more information is needed for risk management. This technique provides a means to evaluate acute hazards and alternative risk reduction strategies, and identify areas for cost-effective risk reduction. There are no simple answers when complex issues are concerned, but CPQRA2 offers a cogent, well-illustrated guide to applying these risk-analysis techniques, particularly to risk control studies.

Implications for Policy and Practice","intitle:risk","[Wesley Brown]","[Education]","This monograph is intended to encourage policy formation and appropriate interventions for young children with emotional/behavioral disorders (E/BD).

The third chapter discusses current assessment and intervention strategies and trends, including prevention and early intervention, family-centered practices, specialized personnel, and differentiated interventions. The fourth chapter presents a model technical assistance program which stresses the importance of home-school-community collaborative planning efforts. It also identifies trends in intervention approaches including classroom-based intervention, parent training and family-based programs, technical assistance teams, and the design of proactive interventions. A concluding chapter stresses the importance of expanding and developing research and model programs which are effective in identifying young children with E/BD and preventing and/or ameliorating further behavioral disabilities.

Will it Survive Government Repression?","intitle:risk","[Alan Greenblatt, CQ Press]","[Blasphemy (Islam)]","Governments around the globe have been weakening free-speech protections because of concerns about security or offending religious believers. After a phone-hacking scandal erupted in the British press and Muslims worldwide violently protested images in the Western media of the Prophet Muhammad, European nations enacted new restrictions on hate speech, and Britain is considering limiting press freedom. Autocratic regimes increasingly are jailing journalists and political dissidents or simply buying media companies to use them for propaganda and to negate criticism. Muslim countries are adopting and rigidly enforcing blasphemy laws, some of which carry the death penalty. Meanwhile, some governments are blocking or monitoring social media and cybertraffic, increasing the risk of arrest for those who freely express their thoughts online and dashing hopes that new technologies would allow unlimited distribution of information and opinion.","2013","http://books.google.es/books?id=-BqunQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=465&source=gbs_api","OCLC:842042925",

"Risk Analysis and Risk Management in Banks","intitle:risk","[Najaf Gharachourlou Aghjelou]",,"In view of growing complexity of banks' business and the dynamic operating environment, risk management has become very significant, especially in the financial sector. Risk at the apex level may be visualized as the probability of a banks' financial health being impaired due to one or more contingent factors. While the parameters indicating the banks' health may vary from net interest margin to market value of equity, the factor which can cause the important are also numerous. For management of risk at corporate level, various risks like credit risk, market risk or operational risk have to be converted into one composite measure. Therefore, it is necessary that measurement of operational risk should be in tandem with other measurements of credit and market risk so that the requisite composite estimate can be worked out. So, regarding to international banking rule (Basel Committee Accords) and RBI guidelines the investigation of risk analysis and risk management in Co-Op banks is being most important.","2012-06","http://books.google.es/books?id=bT1NnwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=557&source=gbs_api","365914908X",

This study aimed to ascertain the general prevalence of risk behavior practices among younger members of the high school community in the greater Cape Town area. Behaviors were assessed along 3 areas of risk: alcohol use, narcotic use and sexual contact. The study consisted of 475 grades 8, 9 and 10 learners attending 8 schools in vastly different socio-demographic areas within the Cape Town Area. The results indicate that youth are engaging in ever increasing numbers of risk behaviours concurrently. Particularly highlighted was the widening gap between youth awareness and actual involvement in risk behavior. Learners report being well informed regarding risk posed to them through these practices, yet despite that still report high rates of involvement in these activities. Within this lies the danger to young people in that they are not empowered to convert awareness knowledge into positive behavioral shifts.","2010-05","http://books.google.es/books?id=WAU1nwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=560&source=gbs_api","3838367405",

"Entrepreneurship and Risk: The Five Forces of Entrepreneurial Risk. Forces That Cause Business Failure and Discontinuance","intitle:risk","[D.

Notably, a remarkably large percentage of people who begin the start-up process terminate it less than one year later. Of those that survive, many are unable to achieve sustained growth and profits. Small-to-medium business enterprises (SME) have a 50% chance of surviving five year or more. There are many variables of risk that influence the survival of a business enterprise. There are five critical forces of entrepreneurial risk: (a) personal characteristics, (b) intangible operations, (c) enterprise operations, (d) market climate, and (e) business environment. Building on key theoretical concepts grounded in economics literature such as endogenous and exogenous risks, this research focuses on examining the five forces of entrepreneurial risk associated with small business failure.","2011-03","http://books.google.es/books?id=BSL-tgAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=570&source=gbs_api","OCLC:163356384",

Investment Policy in Corporate Pension Plans","intitle:risk","[Joshua Rauh]","[Defined benefit pension plans]","The asset allocation of defined benefit pension plans is a setting where both risk shifting and risk management incentives are likely be present. Empirically, firms with poorly funded pension plans and weak credit ratings allocate a greater share of pension fund assets to safer securities such as government debt and cash, whereas firms with well-funded pension plans and strong credit ratings invest more heavily in equity. These relations hold both in the cross-section and within firms and plans over time. The incentive to limit costly financial distress plays a considerably larger role than risk shifting in explaining variation in pension fund investment policy among U.S. firms.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=iMdxcgAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=692&source=gbs_api","OCLC:163308687",

"Rollover Risk and Credit Risk","intitle:risk","[Zhiguo He, Wei Xiong, National Bureau of Economic Research]","[Bankruptcy]","This paper models a firm's rollover risk generated by conflict of interest between debt and equity holders. When the firm faces losses in rolling over its maturing debt, its equity holders are willing to absorb the losses only if the option value of keeping the firm alive justifies the cost of paying off the maturing debt. Our model shows that both deteriorating market liquidity and shorter debt maturity can exacerbate this externality and cause costly firm bankruptcy at higher fundamental thresholds. Our model provides implications on liquidity-spillover effects, the flight-to-quality phenomenon, and optimal debt maturity structures.","2010","http://books.google.es/books?id=8fWJnQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=896&source=gbs_api","OCLC:519570268",

"Terror, Security, and Money: Balancing the Risks, Benefits, and Costs of Homeland Security","intitle:risks","[John Mueller, Mark G. Stewart]","[Technology & Engineering]","In seeking to evaluate the efficacy of post-9/11 homeland security expenses--which have risen by more than a trillion dollars, not including war costs--the common query has been, ""Are we safer?"" This, however, is the wrong question. Of course we are ""safer""--the posting of a single security guard at one building's entrance enhances safety. The correct question is, ""Are any gains in security worth the funds expended?"" In this engaging, readable book, John Mueller and Mark Stewart apply risk and cost-benefit evaluation techniques to answer this very question. This analytical approach has been used throughout the world for decades by regulators, academics, and businesses--but, as a recent National Academy of Science study suggests, it has never been capably applied by the people administering homeland security funds. Given the limited risk terrorism presents, expenses meant to lower it have for the most part simply not been worth it. For example, to be considered cost-effective, increased American homeland security expenditures would have had each year to have foiled up to 1,667 attacks roughly like the one intended on Times Square in 2010--more than four a day. Cataloging the mistakes that the US has made--and continues to make--in managing homeland security programs, Terror, Security, and Money has the potential to redirect our efforts toward a more productive and far more cost-effective course.","2011-09-09","http://books.google.es/books?id=jyYGL2jZBC4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api","9780199912285",

The analysis is based on the simultaneous quotations of premiums for the twenty-two groups of destinations which formed a major part of the commerical matrix of the Netherlands. It considers the operation of the market at two levels. On the one hand, the provision of insurance responded to risk uncertainties in the market: in the 1760s and 1770s, Amsterdam experienced three serious unheavals, in the form of the financial crises of 1763 and 1772-73 and the hostilities leading to American independence and the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. On the other hand, underwriters accepted risks in situations of structural uncertainty.

Then Sanders probes philosophical, historical and systematic theology for further support. And he completes his defense with considerations drawn from practical theology. The God Who Risks is a profound and often inspiring presentation of ""relational theism""--an understanding of providence in which ""a personal God enters into genuine give-and-take relations with his creatures.""

Public agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration are told by political superiors not to inhibit important technological advances and may even be charged with promoting such development but must also make sure that no major accidents occur under their watch. Given the large costs associated with catastrophic accidents, the general public and elected officials often demand reliable or failure-free management of these technologies and have little tolerance for the error. /divDIVResearch in this area has lead to a schism between those who argue that it is possible to have reliable management techniques and safely manage complex technologies and others who contend that such control is difficult at best. In this book C. F. Larry Heimann advances an important solution to this problem by developing a general theory of organizational reliability and agency decision making. The book looks at both external and internal influences on reliability in agency decision making. It then tests theoretical propositions developed in a comparative case study of two agencies involved with the handling of risky technologies: NASA and the manned space flight program and the FDA's handling of pharmaceuticals--particularly new AIDS therapies. /divDIVDrawing on concepts from engineering, organizational theory, political science, and decision theory, this book will be of interest to those interested in science and technology policy, bureaucratic management and reform, as well as those interested in health and space policy. /divDIVC.

"Automobile Insurance: Road Safety, New Drivers, Risks, Insurance Fraud and Regulation. Road Safety, New Drivers, Risks, Insurance Fraud and Regulation","intitle:risks","[Georges Dionne, Claire Laberge-Nadeau]","[Business & Economics]","Motor vehicle accidents are still a leading cause of death, even if the trend has somewhat declined over the past 20 years. Indeed, motor vehicle accidents are a significant cause of death in comparison with air and space transport accidents, homicides and even HIV infections, causes which are more often highlighted in the media. As shown in this book, motor vehicle accidents are particularly damaging to very young drivers. The assessment of driving risks is a common concern for road transportation safety and the automobile insurance industry. In both cases, there is an awareness of the great losses resulting from the deaths, injuries and property damage caused by traffic accidents. Research is essential to counteract this public health threat, to assess the success or failure of countermeasures, and to solve the problems it generates in the insurance industry. This book is for people concerned about road crashes (prevention and compensation) and about the insurance problems they pose - namely private and public institutional authorities, consultants, administrators, practitioners, and researchers interested in sharing the authors' experience in this domain. The book presents original contributions related to motor vehicle insurance and road safety. All papers have been evaluated by external referees. Four subjects are covered: 1) Automobile Insurance Pricing, Risks and Asymmetric Information; 2) Insurance Fraud; 3) Young Drivers: Licensing Policies, Evaluation and Risks; and 4) Road Insurance Regulation.","1999","http://books.google.es/books?id=CoyOr5uvyBwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=72&source=gbs_api","079238394X",

The answer starts with a detailed review of the theory behind risk and decision making by managers. The book then gathers real-world evidence using two surveys of senior managers and directors to analyse why they take risks, and how companies control risks. Integrating theory and evidence the book develops a model of risk taking that draws from academic thinking across multiple disciplines and the actual practice of experienced managers.

"Risks, Reputations, and Rewards. Contingency Fee Legal Practice in the United States","intitle:risks","[Herbert M. Kritzer]","[Law]","Risks, Reputations, and Rewards looks at a variety of interrelated questions about contingency fee legal practice: What is the nature of the contingency fees that lawyers charge? How do lawyers get and screen potential cases? How do contingency fee lawyers interact with their clients and opponents? What is involved in settling these cases? What types of returns do contingency fee cases produce? And what role does reputation play in contingency fee practice? The author argues that to be successful, contingency fee lawyers must generate a portfolio of cases, similar to an investment portfolio with its associated risk. This has a significant impact on how contingency fee lawyers obtain and select cases, manage their work, and deal with the pressures that arise in settling cases. More important, understanding the work of contingency fee lawyers in terms of an ongoing practice rather than in terms of individual cases mitigates some of the significant conflicts that may exist between lawyers and clients.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=MOc_cpjIlwcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=75&source=gbs_api","0804749671",

From a technical point of view, pipelines are complicated three dimensional structures that include straight pipes, nozzles, pipe-bends, dissimilar welded joints, etc. In addition, their operating conditions can be quite severe, that is, internal pressure and cyclic loading (vibration) combined with the influence of internal and external corrosive environments. The external defects, e.g., corrosion defects, gouge, foreign object scratches, and pipeline erection activities are major failure reasons of gas pipelines. All these types of defects and associated failure are described. Leak and fracture of pipes is assumed to be done by initiation and propagation of defect and final failure when defect has reached a critical length. In this book, the three two major defect assessment tools for pipes are presented : i) the failure assessment diagram and particularly the SINTAP procedure, ii) limit analysis, iii) strain design approach Methods of defect repair are based on investigation findings. Methods such as welded sleeve, repair clamp composite sleeve, grinding, pipe replacement are described.","2007-10-25","http://books.google.es/books?id=WV4c-HpDh5EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=79&source=gbs_api","9781402065248",
"Main Types of Political Risks Experienced by MNEs","intitle:risks","[Svenja Martina Gnosa]",,"Essay from the year 2011 in the subject Business economics - Marketing, Corporate Communication, CRM, Market Research, Social Media, grade: 1,3, University of St Andrews (School of Management), language: English, abstract: Identify the main types of political risk encountered by multinational corporations and discuss how these risks can be minimized. Introduction The controversy between the Kazak government and the Italian oil company ENI about the exploitation of Kashagans oil fields is only one out of many cases, in which political violence acts or governmental decisions threatened foreign investments of a multinational enterprise (MNE). In April 2006, the Dacion and Jusepin oil fields, operated by ENI and the French company Total, were taken over by the Venezuelan government, because they rejected to change their business operations into joint ventures with the state-owned oil company PDVSA (Ferrari and Rolfini 2008). Stated by Kesternich and Schnitzer (2009) some recent empirical studies identified that for MNEs political risk is one of the most important factors when considering a foreign investment. Foreign investments nowadays seem to be even more risky in terms of pollution that result in natural catastrophes such as caused by BP (Heller 2011), cultural conflicts or political disturbances for which Lybia (Yang 2011) represents a recent example and an increasing social disparity (Bloch, Koepplinger and Wolfrum 2007) [...]","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=2d5tZ9ZqG4QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=80&source=gbs_api","9783640961757",

The purpose of this book is to provide a background of the many aspects of hazardous waste, from its sources to its consequences, focusing on the risks posed to human health and the environment. It explains the legislation and regulations surrounding hazardous waste; however, the scope of the book is much broader, discussing agents that are released into the environment that might not be classified as hazardous waste under the regulatory system, but nonetheless pose substantial hazards to human health and the environment. It provides a background of some of the major generators of hazardous wastes, explains the pathways by which humans and wildlife are exposed, and includes discussion of the adverse health effects linked to these pollutants. It provides numerous case studies of hazardous waste mismanagement that have led to disastrous consequences, and highlights the deficiencies in science and regulation that have allowed the public to be subjected to myriad potentially hazardous agents. Finally, it provides a discussion of measures that will need to be taken to control societys hazardous waste problem. This book was designed to appeal to a wide range of audiences, including students, professionals, and general readers interested in the topic.

"Calculated Risks. How to Know When Numbers Deceive You","intitle:risks",,"[Education]","At the beginning of the twentieth century, H. G. Wells predicted that statistical thinking would be as necessary for citizenship in a technological world as the ability to read and write. But in the twenty-first century, we are often overwhelmed by a baffling array of percentages and probabilities as we try to navigate in a world dominated by statistics. Cognitive scientist Gerd Gigerenzer says that because we haven't learned statistical thinking, we don't understand risk and uncertainty. In order to assess risk -- everything from the risk of an automobile accident to the certainty or uncertainty of some common medical screening tests -- we need a basic understanding of statistics. Astonishingly, doctors and lawyers don't understand risk any better than anyone else. Gigerenzer reports a study in which doctors were told the results of breast cancer screenings and then were asked to explain the risks of contracting breast cancer to a woman who received a positive result from a screening. The actual risk was small because the test gives many false positives. But nearly every physician in the study overstated the risk. Yet many people will have to make important health decisions based on such information and the interpretation of that information by their doctors. Gigerenzer explains that a major obstacle to our understanding of numbers is that we live with an illusion of certainty. Many of us believe that HIV tests, DNA fingerprinting, and the growing number of genetic tests are absolutely certain. But even DNA evidence can produce spurious matches. We cling to our illusion of certainty because the medical industry, insurance companies, investment advisers, and election campaigns have become purveyors of certainty, marketing it like a commodity. To avoid confusion, says Gigerenzer, we should rely on more understandable representations of risk, such as absolute risks. For example, it is said that a mammography screening reduces the risk of breast cancer by 25 percent. But in absolute risks, that means that out of every 1,000 women who do not participate in screening, 4 will die; while out of 1,000 women who do, 3 will die. A 25 percent risk reduction sounds much more significant than a benefit that 1 out of 1,000 women will reap. This eye-opening book explains how we can overcome our ignorance of numbers and better understand the risks we may be taking with our money, our health, and our lives.","2002","http://books.google.es/books?id=KJ7nrlJqcRYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=100&source=gbs_api","9780743254236",

Coleman]","[Philosophy]","This book by one of America's preeminent legal theorists is concerned with the conflict between the goals of justice and economic efficiency in the allocation of risk, especially risk pertaining to safety. The author approaches his subject from the premise that the market is central to liberal political, moral, and legal theory. In the first part of the book, he rejects traditional ""rational choice"" liberalism in favor of the view that the market operates as a rational way of fostering stable relationships and institutions within communities of individuals with broadly divergent conceptions of the good. However, markets are needed most where they are most difficult to create and sustain, and one way to understand contract law in liberal legal theory, according to Professor Coleman, is as an institution designed to reduce uncertainty and thereby make markets possible. Another target of this book is the prevalent view that tort law helps rectify market failures when transaction costs are too high to permit contracting. The author argues instead that tort law should be understood as a way of rectifying wrongful losses not inefficient exchanges.","1992","http://books.google.es/books?id=Afc3AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=105&source=gbs_api","0521428610",

Since then, however, a series of eventssuch as emerging-market debt crises, bond-market meltdowns, and the Long-Term Capital Management episodehas forced a rethinking of the risks facing financial institutions and the tools available to measure and manage these risks. The Risks of Financial Institutions examines the various risks affecting financial institutions and explores a variety of methods to help institutions and regulators more accurately measure and forecast risk. The contributors--from academic institutions, regulatory organizations, and banking--bring a wide range of perspectives and experience to the issue. The result is a volume that points a way forward to greater financial stability and better risk management of financial institutions.","2007-11-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=mTWtpwkGYGgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=106&source=gbs_api","9780226092980",

"The Risks of Knowledge. Investigations Into the Death of the Hon.

The commission ran for seventeen months in 1990-91 before the president shut it down. International and Kenyan unrest over Ouko's brutal death brought increasing attention to corruption and violence associated with the Moi government, leading in late 1991 to multiparty politics and in December 2002 to the elections that ended the Moi era. This powerfully argued book raises important issues about the production of knowledge and the politics of memory that will interest a large interdisciplinary audience. An inquiry into how facts are created and knowledge produced, The Risks of Knowledge pursues a ghastly murder into the normally unseen worlds of international business wheeling and dealing, into the rural ""squireocracy"" of western Kenya, and into the bureaucratic routines of Kenya's government. In this, their third coauthored study of Kenya, the authors show how these unfinished investigations are about much more than the solution to the murder of a distinguished Kenyan statesman and world citizen.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=JOHBLpEmiEAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=110&source=gbs_api","9780821415979",

One commodity that went through peaks and troughs is without doubt oil. A wide range of companies with business activities relying on the commodity and stable pricing, also went through highs and lows, whilst some went into liquidation. This circumstance let many companies think carefully about their risk exposure and how they effectively can manage it. This paper shows that: The main exercise to mitigate risk is a well-structured risk management operation which deliver the fundamentals for an effective usage of derivative instruments. Prior to any securing activity with swaps or options, companies must pin-point their current risk position, portfolios and their values. On this, the classical portfolio theory with the various modern extensions and portfolio analysis tools deliver a good concept for this question, however, oil has cer tain characteristics which companies need to take into consideration. Furthermore, the portfolio theory may not helping to mitigate risk that is driven by economic factors, hence, spreading risk in an essential part, but some risks can only be addressed other means.

"The Ecological Risks of Engineered Crops","intitle:risks","[Jane Rissler, Margaret G. Mellon]","[Science]","What will it mean to have a steady stream of animal and microbial genes entering thegene pools of plants in wild ecosystems?Private companies and the federal government are pouringsignificant resources into biotechnology, and the major application of genetic engineering toagriculture is transgenic crops. This carefully reasoned science and policy assessment shows thatthe commercialization and release of transgenic crops on millions of acres of farmland can poseserious -- and costly -- environmental risks. The authors propose a practical, feasible method ofconducting precommercialization evaluations that will balance the needs of ecological safety withthose of agriculture and business, and that will assist governments seeking to identify and protectagainst two of the most significant risks.Rissler and Mellon first define transgenic plants andreview research currently under way in the field of crop biotechnology. They then identify andcategorize the environmental risks presented by commercial uses of transgenic crops. These includethe potential of transgenic crops to become weeds or to produce weeds with transgene properties suchas herbicide resistance that may require costly control programs. Plants engineered to contain virusparticles may facilitate the creation of new viruses that can affect economically importantcrops.Looking at global seed trade, the authors discuss the relationship between commercial approvalin the United States and environmental risks abroad. Of particular concern is the flow of novelgenes into the centers of crop biodiversity, primarily in the developing world, that could threatenthe genetic base of the world's future food supply.The authors conclude by reviewing the currentstatus of U.S. regulations governing transgenic crops. They discuss the difficulties that this newterrain presents to regulators, and offer recommendations concerning the commercial development,risk assessment, and regulation of these crops.Copublished with the Union of ConcernedScientists","1996","http://books.google.es/books?id=omRUQ6p2szAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=113&source=gbs_api","0262680858",
"Balancing Risks. Great Power Intervention in the Periphery","intitle:risks","[Jeffrey W. Taliaferro]","[Business & Economics]","Great powers often initiate risky military and diplomatic inventions in far-off, peripheral regions that pose no direct threat to them, risking direct confrontation with rivals in strategically inconsequential places. Why do powerful countries behave in a way that leads to entrapment in prolonged, expensive, and self-defeating conflicts?Jeffrey W. Taliaferro suggests that such interventions are driven by the refusal of senior officials to accept losses in their state's relative power, international status, or prestige. Instead of cutting their losses, leaders often continue to invest blood and money in failed excursions into the periphery. Their policies may seem to be driven by rational concerns about power and security, but Taliaferro deems them to be at odds with the master explanation of political realism.Taliaferro constructs a ""balance-of-risk"" theory of foreign policy that draws on defensive realism (in international relations) and prospect theory (in psychology).

In the course of an onward globalisation and with an increasing stress of competition, it becomes more and more difficult for entrepreneurs to keep or to improve their market position. For this account, strategic planning comes into the main focus to choose the best strategy for a business. However, every business man knows that there are always chances and risks in economic life. For this reason, risks cannot be eliminated, but they can be managed. Especially in the airline industry, the competition is on a very high level. Since 2001 more and more low cost carriers have been competing with the big well known national airline companies like Lufthansa or British Airways. That's why a well thought out strategic management, strategic planning and of course risk management are essential to overcome the stress of competition. This report will analyse why risk management is so important in strategic planning. By evaluating different models and techniques, the best method to analyse the internal and external environment will be elaborated. By using a current business paper, in that case the annual report of British Airways Plc 2007, different kinds of risks will be analysed and strategies will be given, to overcome and mitigate those risks.","2013-10","http://books.google.es/books?id=tdHxtGfJQ68C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=119&source=gbs_api","9783640862290",

"Catalogue of Risks. Natural, Technical, Social and Health Risks","intitle:risks","[Ulrike Proske]","[Business & Economics]","The term risk has experienced a dramatic growth in usage over the last few years. This is mainly due to the growing concern about the future of mankind, but also to a greater awareness of the limited nature of our resources. People want to know what can go wrong. In the beginning terms such as risk, disaster, indeterminacy and uncertainty are discussed in detail in this book. Furthermore disasters and risks are categorized into natural, technical, health and social risks, and then major disasters in these categories are listed. Risk parameters are introduced to allow the objective description of risks. The explanation of risk parameters (such as mortalities, fatal accident rates, the family of F-N curves and the concept of lost life years) leads to the quality of life parameters as measurements of risk. In general this parameter permits the comparison of the efficiency of all safety measures over the entire human society. However, limitations of this concept are also disclosed. The book clearly shows the interdependence of risk measures. Safety and risks cannot be discussed only by looking at specific problems, since increasing safety in individual fields might lead to a decrease of safety over the entire society.","2008-07-24","http://books.google.es/books?id=cNKAM1LTIBUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=124&source=gbs_api","9783540795551",

"Classical Competing Risks","intitle:risks","[Martin J. Crowder]","[Mathematics]","If something can fail, it can often fail in one of several ways and sometimes in more than one way at a time. There is always some cause of failure, and almost always, more than one possible cause. In one sense, then, survival analysis is a lost cause. The methods of Competing Risks have often been neglected in the survival analysis literature. Written by a leading statistician, Classical Competing Risks thoroughly examines the probability framework and statistical analysis of data of Competing Risks. The author explores both the theory of the subject and the practicalities of fitting the models to data. In a coherent, self-contained, and sequential account, the treatment moves from the bare bones of the Competing Risks setup and the associated likelihood functions through survival analysis using hazard functions. It examines discrete failure times and the difficulties of identifiability, and concludes with an introduction to the counting-process approach and the associated martingale theory. With a dearth of modern treatments on the subject and the importance of its methods, this book fills a long-standing gap in the literature with a carefully organized exposition, real data sets, numerous examples, and clear, readable prose. If you work with lifetime data, Classical Competing Risks presents a modern, comprehensive overview of the methodology and theory you need.","2001-05-11","http://books.google.es/books?id=Fr1c-WxnFdsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=127&source=gbs_api","1584881755",

"New risks, new welfare. the transformation of the European welfare state","intitle:risks","[Peter Taylor-Gooby]","[Political Science]","This book introduces the concept of new social risks in welfare state studies and explains their relevance to the comparative understanding of social policy in Europe. New social risks arise from shifts in the balance of work and family life as a direct result of the declining importance of the male breadwinner family, changes in the labor market, and the impact of globalization on national policy-making. They differ from the old social risks of the standard industrial life-course, which were concerned primarily with interruptions to income from sickness, unemployment, retirement, and similar issues. New social risks pose new challenges for the welfare policies of European countries, such as the care of children and the elderly, more equal opportunities, the activation of labor markets and the management of needs that arise from welfare state reform, and new opportunities for the coordination of policies at the EU level. The book includes detailed and up-to-date case studies of policy development across these areas in the major European countries. These studies, written by leading experts, are organized in a comparative framework which is followed throughout the book. They highlight the way in which national welfare state regimes and institutional arrangements shape policy-making to meet new social risks. A major feature of this volume is the analysis of developments at the EU level and their interaction with national policies. The EU has been largely unsuccessful in its interventions in old social risk policy, but appears to have more success in its attempts to coordinate policy for new social risks. Experience here may provide lessons for future developments in EU policy-making. The comparative framework of the book seeks to inform an understanding of the development of new social risks in Europe and of the particular political opportunities and challenges that result. It provides an original analysis of pressing issues at the forefront of European welfare policy debate and locates it at the heart of current theoretical debates.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=spESAQAAMAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=164&source=gbs_api","UOM:39015059290364",

Barnhill, Panagiotis Papapanagiotou]",,"The banking crises of the 1990s emphasize the need to model the connections between volatility and the potential losses faced by financial institutions due to correlated market and credit risks. We present a simulation model that explicitly links changes in the financial environment and the distribution of future bank capital ratios. This forward-looking quantitative risk assessment methodology allows banks and regulators to identify risks before they materialize and make appropriate adjustments to banks portfolios. This model was applied to the study of the risk profile of the largest South African banks in the context of the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) (1999).","2000-12-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=wNXwngEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=165&source=gbs_api","145187488X",

In 1963, when traditional values are coming under attack, a young woman in her twenties, Venetia Flaxton, becomes disastrously involved with her best friend's father, the powerful, dynamic but ultimately mysterious Dean of Starbridge Cathedral. Yet, as a married man and a senior Churchman, Aysgarth has nothing to offer her but an admiration which spirals out of control into an obsessive love. As Aysgarth begins to take scandalous risks to further their friendship, pressures rise and the dangers multiply. Venetia finds herself trapped in a desperate web of love and lies from which it seems impossible to escape. Witty, compassionate and compelling, Scandalous Risks explores not only the reality of sin and the fantasy of sexual obsession, but the overpowering human need for redemption, love and lasting happiness.","2012-06-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=Wo4GngEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=168&source=gbs_api","0007396414",

"Managing the risks of organizational accidents","intitle:risks","[J. T. Reason]","[Business & Economics]","Major accidents are rare events due to the many barriers, safeguards and defences developed by modern technologies. But they continue to happen with saddening regularity and their human and financial consequences are all too often unacceptably catastrophic. One of the challenges facing the next millennium is to develop more effective ways of both understanding and limiting their occurrence.This lucid book presents a set of common principles to further our knowledge of the causes of major accidents in a wide variety of high technology systems. It also describes tools and techniques for managing the risks of such organizational accidents that go beyond those currently available to system managers and safety professionals.The Author deals comprehensively with the prevention of major accidents arising from human and organizational causes. He argues that the same general principles and management techniques are appropriate for many different domains. These include banks and insurance companies just as much as nuclear power plants, oil exploration and production companies, chemical process installations and air, sea and rail transport.Its unique combination of principles and practicalities make this book essential reading for those people whose daily business is to manage, audit and regulate hazardous technologies of all kinds. It is relevant to those concerned with understanding and controlling human and organizational factors and will also interest academic readers and those working in industrial and government agencies.","1997","http://books.google.es/books?id=ZnhRAAAAMAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=170&source=gbs_api","UOM:39015040046412",

Twenty-four scientists have come together to present their views on risks in technological systems. Their scientific disciplines cover not only engineering, economics and medicine, but also history, psychology, literature and philosophy. Taken together these contributions provide a broad, but accurate, interdisciplinary introduction to a field of increasing global interest, as well as rich opportunities to achieve in-depth knowledge of the subject.","2010","http://books.google.es/books?id=D7oVngEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=177&source=gbs_api","1848826419",

"Environmental Justice, Civil Society and Industrial Risks","intitle:risks","[Llewellyn Leonard]",,"This book conceives of South African society as a risk society and seeks to map the extent to which civil society actors' champion environmental justice in an industrial risk society. It examines the role of civil society actors specifically in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, and their ability to perceive industrial risks and help push grassroots concerns in public policy and development processes in a state that has not completely undergone a movement into a post or late modern society. Under Apartheid government, the urban environment was a means for racist oppression with Blacks sharing their neighbourhoods with polluting industries. Under the new democratic government, little may have changed. Government has chosen to engage in a macroeconomic development model concentrated on expanding industrial modes of production. The logic of wealth production has dominated the logic of risk production contributing to increased industrial risks in society. Work includes empirical analysis to explore how civil society champions environmental justice, and will be valuable for those interested in knowing more about environmental justice, industrial risks, governance and development issues.","2009-11","http://books.google.es/books?id=MLnTnQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=183&source=gbs_api","3838316118",

"Challenges and Risks","intitle:risks","[Shah Ehsan Habib]",,"This thesis is aimed at investigating the patterns of injecting drug use and hepatitis C (HCV).Traditional psychological models are unable to explain why people cannot avoid risk behaviour in certain situations. By contrast, the harm reduction model, despite being relatively poorly theorised, can be seen as useful in giving an account of behaviour change, with particular reference to HCV-related risk behaviour.The thesis uses a self-reported questionnaire to identify risk behaviours for HCV transmission and to examine their relationships to demographic and social factors. A survey of Injecting Drug Users(IDUs) attending needle and syringe programs in the Sydney metropolitan area and members of NSW Users & AIDS Association yielded 336 responses. The results suggest that more than two thirds of the subjects had adopted some measures to avoid risky situations.Unavailability of needles and syringes was an important factor in determining IDUs' preparedness to share needles and syringes. Risky injecting practices are linked to stigmatisation of injecting drug use which obstructs users' access to information and clean equipment and the lack of reliable information concerning the transmission of hepatitis C.","2009-11","http://books.google.es/books?id=2oIUngEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=185&source=gbs_api","3838315553",

Policy makers, human rights activists, state environmental and resource institutions, mining companies and allied organizations, district chief executives, traditional authorities, community leaders, academic and research institutions, students and non-governmental organizations will benefit from contemporary and practical issues on how rural farmers perceive and associate risks with mining, and what to consider when determining compensation packages for the affected communities.","2012","http://books.google.es/books?id=vABAnwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=186&source=gbs_api","3659286850",
"Ontology in Modernity Risks","intitle:risks","[Birgitte Jacobsen]",,"Societal security is a concept of increasing significance. It is tightly connected to risk, since both concepts deal with the future. The understanding of risk is crucial in risk assessment, because it constitute the basis for legislation, control and regulation. Ontology is essential, because different ontological foundations will be materialized in different understandings of risk, risk assessment, risk management and thus appear as different ontological foundation for societal risk governance. In socio-technical research, objective or subjective ontology dominates. Relational ontology often is absent, which contributes to reductionistic risk assessment. Modernity risks are, however, a relational phenomenon, products of structuration, and must be understood accordingly. Connotations are a product of structuration and constitute different building blocks with patterns of thoughts about risks which are established by objective physical and social structures, subjective preferences and relational structuration. Connotations are thus important to make explicit and understand the constructions of societal regulation and control and to understand the production of modernity risks.","2012-06","http://books.google.es/books?id=oaDGngEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=187&source=gbs_api","3659146153",

"Displacement Risks in Africa","intitle:risks","[Itaru Ohta, Yntiso D.

As the powerful nations of the world are mobilized to tackle domestic conflicts and their ensuing refugee problems in the Balkans, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and elsewhere, African societies have typically been abandoned by the international community to resolving their own conflicts through their own means. The authors of this volume examine both causes and effects of displacement in terms of both local and global politics, environmental risks, socio-economic costs, and policy and identity issues. Combined, these papers provide a powerful if not comprehensive overview of the variety and complexity of circumstances concerning displaced persons.","2005","http://books.google.es/books?id=UHoEfZpLNtsC&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=224&source=gbs_api","1920901094",

According to a recent survey, about seventy percent of banks consider operational risk as important as market or credit risks. Nearly a quarter of the same banks admit to operation-related losses of more than $1.6 million-many cases are so embarrassing that banks will not actually admit any error on their part. Firms are just beginning to develop their own operational risk management systems and they need guidance on how to do it. This book will help them identify, measure, and manage their operational risks.

"Uncertain Risks Regulated","intitle:risks","[Ellen Vos, Michelle Everson]","[Law]","Uncertain Risks Regulated compares various models of risk regulation in order to understand how these systems shape the relationship between law and science, and how they attempt to overcome public distrust in science-based decision-making. The book contributes to the ongoing debate relating to uncertainty and risks - and the difficulties faced by the European Union in particular - in regulating theses issues, taking account of both national and international constraints. The term 'uncertain risk' is comparable with notions of hazard and indeterminate risk, as deployed within the social sciences; but it also aims to capture the modern regulatory reality that a non-quantifiable hazard must still be addressed by society, law and its regulators. Decisions must be taken in the face of uncertainty. And, whilst it is not possible to provide clear cut models of risk regulation, in focusing on regulatory practices at a national, EU and international level, the contributors to this volume aim to use fact finding as a core instrument of learning for risk regulation.","2008-12-12","http://books.google.es/books?id=DgjTCsWlIGwC&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=236&source=gbs_api","9780203884850",

Psychology]","[Criminal justice, Administration of]","To better understand the perception of risk of crime, a replication of the three factor structure of Dread risk, Unknown risk and Number of People Exposed of societal risks delineated by Slovic, Fischhoff and Lichtenstein (1980) was undertaken. Twelve societal hazards and five criminal justice hazards were examined. A two factor structure resulted, with Factor 1 best described as Dread risk and Factor 2, Uncertainty. Criminal justice hazards were predominantly located in the high Factor 1, low Factor 2 quadrant of the two Factor space. Results confirm that people tend to overestimate the rate of crime; however, their estimates are not related to dread risk, uncertainty or perceived risk. An awareness of risks and benefits of releasing offenders is not related to perception of risk of criminal justice hazards. Being a victim of crime was not found to affect perceived risk, dread risk or uncertainty of crime. Gender differences in perception were observed.","2006","http://books.google.es/books?id=qU1OSLvuao8C&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=260&source=gbs_api","0494182652",

Or is this belief the expression of an untenable ""idealised image of bourgeois civilization"" sustained through the categorical barbarization of violence in developing countries? Prevalent theories indicate that participation and inclusion of political actors as well as governmental capacity are crucial to understand the relation between political violence and regime types. During the period of democratization, regimes change and with them their particular patterns of state-society interaction. Transitional regimes go through a period of increased risks of political violence. Therefore, authoritarian regimes are more likely to suffer political violence in the future.","2012-05","http://books.google.es/books?id=XIcUngEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=267&source=gbs_api","3656183953",

"Adolescents' Health Risks Behaviors: A Comparison of Alternative High School Students to High School Students Nationwide","intitle:risks","[Sharon Jo Sherlock]",,"School administrators and leaders in community health need accurate assessment data to prioritize adolescent behavioral health risks and to develop effective risk reduction programs in alternative high schools. The purpose of the study was to compare adolescents from two alternative high schools in Dayton, Ohio to their peers nationwide on the following behavioral risk factors: self-description of weight, at risk for becoming overweight, prevalence of asthma, fruit consumption, weapon carrying, physical fights, missed school days due to feeling unsafe and suicidal thoughts. With a web-based version of the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) 2003 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), data were obtained for a convenience sample of 228 alternative high school students aged 14-23 (participation rate 69%). Comparison data came from a 2003 YRBS study by the CDC, n = 15,214. Alternative high school students were significantly more likely to be African American, older and in a lower grade level than students who participated in the CDC's 2003 YRBS. Therefore, overall chi-square comparisons were followed by tests performed in the following subgroups: African American, Caucasian, 14-16 years old, students aged 17 or older, and older students enrolled in low grades. Alternative high school students participated in physical fights more frequently than their peers nationwide. This finding was statistically significant overall (for the entire sample) and within each ethnic and age-based subgroup. Students in alternative high schools were at a significantly greater risk for becoming overweight, as indicated by age-adjusted BMI. Overall, alternative high school students had a higher prevalence of asthma and carried a weapon more frequently than students nationwide, but these findings were not replicated in any subgroup. Compared to their peers nationwide, alternative school students aged 17 or older were more likely to report non-attendance due to fears for personal safety. This research effort supports the CDC's national initiative, Healthy People 2010. In collaboration with alternative high schools, healthcare professionals can apply this new knowledge to develop community-based health programs.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=DSIQuQAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=288&source=gbs_api","1109952961",

Over time, however, the market's capacity to absorb new debt will likely shrink as population ages and risk appetite recovers. In the short term, a decline in fund supply from the corporate sector, where financial surpluses are abnormally high, and spillovers from global financial distress could push up JGB yields. Fiscal reforms to reduce public debt more quickly and lengthen the maturity of government bonds will help limit these risks.","2011-12-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=3_awkQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=456&source=gbs_api","OCLC:768977127",

The research questions answered were: 1. What risks are there to the use of Halon? 2. What risks are there to the elimination of Halon? 3. What replacements are available for Halons? 4. What alternatives are there for total phase out? A review of the literature showed that the risks to the environment were documented and substantial over a period of time. The review also showed that there were essential areas where higher levels of loss potential may substantiate the use of Halons.","1995","http://books.google.es/books?id=VIb3SAAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=478&source=gbs_api","OCLC:502524955",

Estimation with Time Aggregation","intitle:risks","[Ravi Bansal, Dana Kiku, Amir Yaron, National Bureau of Economic Research]","[Economics]","The long-run risks (LRR) asset pricing model emphasizes the role of low-frequency movements in expected growth and economic uncertainty, along with investor preferences for early resolution of uncertainty, as an important economic-channel that determines asset prices. In this paper, we estimate the LRR model. To accomplish this we develop a method that allows us to estimate models with recursive preferences, latent state variables, and time-aggregated data. Time-aggregation makes the decision interval of the agent an important parameter to estimate. We find that time-aggregation can significantly affect parameter estimates and statistical inference. Imposing the pricing restrictions and explicitly accounting for time-aggregation, we show that the estimated LRR model can account for the joint dynamics of aggregate consumption, asset cash flows and prices, including the equity premia, risk-free rate and volatility puzzles.","2012","http://books.google.es/books?id=jPI_MwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=480&source=gbs_api","OCLC:807519674",

An expression for the asymptotic correlation between a pair of mortality rates is thus obtained and a necessary and sufficient condition for their asymptotic independence is investigated in some general situations with reference to only the cause-specific failure rates and the survival function of the individuals.

One possible solution to satisfy at least the shareholders and customers is offshore outsourcing of IT/IS-services. Information technology (IT) and information systems (IS) are very complex topics in many cases and cause high costs. During the recession, cost cutting is often the number one strategy to keep the business running and beyond the break-even.","2010-08-17","http://books.google.es/books?id=fn09nwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=551&source=gbs_api","364068317X",

"Nuclear Energy: Balancing Benefits and Risks. April 2007","intitle:risks","[Charles D. Ferguson]","[Business & Economics]","""Increased concern over energy security and global climate change has led many people to take a fresh look at the benefits and risks of nuclear power for the United States and other countries. The debate surrounding nuclear energy also intersects with critical U.S. foreign policy issues such as nuclear proliferation and terrorism. This Council Special Report, produced in partnership with Washington and Lee University and written by the Council's Fellow for Science and Technology Charles D. Ferguson, provides the factual and analytical background to inform this debate. Nuclear Energy: Balancing Benefits and Risks is a sobering and authoritative look at nuclear power. Dr. Ferguson argues that nuclear energy, despite its attributes, is unlikely to play a major role in the coming decades in strengthening energy security or in countering the harmful effects of climate change. In particular, the rapid rate of nuclear reactor expansion required to make even a modest reduction in global warming would drive up construction costs and create shortages in building materials, trained personnel, and safety controls. There are also lingering questions over nuclear waste, as well as continued political opposition to siting new plants. Nonetheless, the report points out steps the United States could take--such as imposing a fee on greenhouse gas emissions--to level the economic playing field for all energy sectors, which over the long run would encourage the construction of new nuclear reactors (if only to replace existing ones that will need to be retired) and help reduce global warming. Dr. Ferguson has written a fair and balanced report that brings the nuclear energy debate down from one of preferences and ideologies to one of reality. Nuclear Energy: Balancing Benefits and Risks is useful to anyone who wants to understand both the potential and the limits of nuclear power to enhance energy security and slow climate change.""--Provided by publisher.","2007-06-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=ESVVYtZ98-IC&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=559&source=gbs_api","0876094000",
"Separate and Unequal Risks for Victimization? An Examination of City-level Conditions on Victimization Risks","intitle:risks","[Toya Z. Like]",,"The relationship between city conditions and risks for non-fatal victimization has been relatively ignored in the victimization literature. Little is known about the risks for victimization at the city-level or whether 'known' correlates of victimization at the individual- and neighborhood-level vary across city context. This study examines the relationship between city conditions and non-fatal victimization. Furthermore, the risks for victimization at the individual-, neighborhood-, and city-level are considered simultaneously. Because the study includes twelve different cities, examinations of individual and neighborhood factors across cities can also be examined. Lastly, macro-level research has suggested that risks for victimization vary across race and ethnicity. Therefore, the importance of these relationships among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics is considered. The findings reveal that city context is indeed associated with non-fatal victimization among cities. However, there appear to be no substantive differences in the relationship between individual and neighborhood factors and non-fatal victimization across cities. Individual and neighborhood risks for non-fatal victimization are similar regardless of the city being studied. However, there does appear to be substantive differences in risks for non-fatal victimization across racial/ethnic groups. The relevance of these findings to victimization research and theory and the policy implications of the results are also discussed.","2006","http://books.google.es/books?id=DeB0T4RGWDEC&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=560&source=gbs_api","054928348X",

One recent development has been the emergence of plastic cards with the capacity to store value electronically, which can be used for a range of retail transactions. With the advent of comprehensive anti-money laundering laws throughout the developed world, criminals are turning to alternative ways of moving funds across borders to circumvent reporting and detection systems. One identified risk is the misuse of prepaid stored value cards to keep the proceeds of crime and move them across borders without alerting law enforcement and financial intelligence units. This paper describes the nature of these risks and considers whether existing regulatory measures are adequate to address them.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=YE3stgAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=606&source=gbs_api","1921185929",

"Die Versicherbarkeit von Emerging Risks in der Haftpflichtversicherung","intitle:risks","[Hannah Teschabai-Oglu]","[Law]","Klimawandel, Pandemierisiko, zunehmender Terrorismus, elektromagnetische Felder, Gentechnik oder Nanotechnologie - all dies sind Emerging Risks, neuartige Risiken mit ungewissem, möglicherweise aber katastrophalem Schädigungspotenzial. Jene Risiken stellen insbesondere die Haftpflichtversicherer vor gewaltige Herausforderungen. Trotz ihrer erheblichen praktischen Bedeutung sind sie wissenschaftlich bislang noch weitgehend unerforscht. Diese Lücke schließt die Autorin mit der vorliegenden Arbeit. Sie untersucht die Frage, ob Emerging Risks in der Haftpflichtversicherung versicherbar sind bzw. wie sie versicherbar gemacht werden können. Hierzu wird zunächst geklärt, inwiefern eine Haftung für Emerging Risks - derzeit oder künftig - zu befürchten steht. Anschließend werden Kriterien für die Versicherbarkeit eines Risikos auf Emerging Risks angewandt. Den Schwerpunkt der Arbeit bildet die Untersuchung der verschiedenen, sich dem Versicherer bietenden risikopolitischen Instrumente, mit deren Hilfe die Versicherbarkeit von Emerging Risks verbessert werden kann. Behandelt werden dabei insbesondere folgende Instrumente: - Vereinbarung einer Bedingungsanpassungsklausel - Vereinbarung risikobegrenzender Obliegenheiten - Ausschluss bestimmter Teilrisiken - Umstellung auf das Anspruchserhebungsprinzip - Zeitliche Risikobegrenzungen - Betragsmäßige Risikobegrenzungen - Vereinbarung einer Serienschadenklausel Von Interesse ist die Arbeit insbesondere für Makler und Produktmanager in Versicherungsunternehmen, die sich mit künftigen Haftungsrisiken und der Möglichkeit ihrer Versicherung befassen, aber auch an Führungskräfte, die für technologische Emerging Risks in innovativen Branchen Verantwortung tragen.","2012-09-25","http://books.google.es/books?id=0Dl_7Zq8d1gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=668&source=gbs_api","9783899527070",

The run-up, larger than any other in U.K. history, leveled off early last year. House prices are currently declining at rates faster than those seen in the early 1990's downturn. The housing downturn, however, is far from complete. Using the price-rent ratio as a guide, house prices are likely to fall at least a further 30 percent before leveling off. Given the historic links between housing and real activity, the downturn is likely to be associated with very slow growth.

Earlier in the crisis, the increase in market-implied contagion led to higher Asian sovereign bond yield spreads over swaps. But, after the crisis, Asia's sovereign spreads normalized, despite the debt crisis in the euro area, reflecting a fall in both exchange rate and spillover risks.","2011-06-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=yZXDngEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=689&source=gbs_api","1462310230",

We develop regression models of the fundamental determinants of bank credit and use them to examine whether they can fully explain developments in rapid credit growth countries. We then argue that rapid credit expansion, whether a manifestation of a credit boom or driven by fundamentals, can give rise to prudential and macroeconomic risks. We detail these risks and discuss the choice of policies to mitigate them. We conclude by evaluating the likely impact of the ongoing global recession and financial crisis on credit growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.","2009-08-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=6S4hngEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=706&source=gbs_api","1451988249",

"A Proposal for the Development of Exposure (to Risk) Information for Measuring and Monitoring Road Accident Risks. A ""risk Analysis System"" for Improving Road Safety","intitle:risks","[Delbert E. Stewart, Canada. Road Safety, Canada. Sécurité routière, Canada. Programmes de la sécurité routière. Évaluation et systèmes de données]","[Traffic accidents]","Traffic safety managers are constantly faced with the problem of making decisions on which, and of these the best, measures and countermeasures to implement for addressing their main goal - improving road safety. The ability to make these decisions effectively is dependent upon the availability of suitable and contemporary research information on the incidence of travel and accidents occurring on our roads and highways. To this end an area crucial to traffic safety research is the development of evaluation methods for measuring and subsequently identifying high risk travel patterns. This component of the countermeasure development process is difficult to pursue since the overall risk of accident occurrence is directly affected by the joint interactive effects of numerous human, vehicle, road/infrastructure, environment, trip and temporal travel pattern risk levels existing within the transportation system. Other factors (e.g., countermeasure programs, economic conditions, vehicle/driver regulations, social factors) also influence the prevailing risk levels, at any given time, for road system users. This report discusses various aspects of an exposure (to risk) data collection system that forms the basis for developing a risk analysis sytem in order to measure and monitor road travel incident risks. Specifically, the relationships among causal factors, risk levels and incidence of accidents, injuries and fatalities are presented. The conceptual concepts of a risk analysis system process for measuring, monitoring and improving road safety are described. The 'key' information requirements to be considered within the framework of an exposure (to risk) data collection system are identified. A variety of methods are available from collecting exposure (to risk) information - these are discussed along with factors to be considered in their implementation. The applications and uses of exposure (to risk) information towards the main objective of making road travel 'safer' are also discussed. The report concludes with a discussion of the 1978-1979 National Exposure (To Risk) Driving Survey - the other effort, to date, to collect national exposure (to risk) data, and offers some conclusions and recommendations related to the development and implementation of a 'risk analysis system' for measuring and monitoring the levels of risk on Canada's roads and highways.","1998","http://books.google.es/books?id=WzAxHQAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=737&source=gbs_api","OCLC:270340640",

Useful as a quick reference guide to generate reminders in the exam. Reduces the time that you will need to invest in the crucial area of Audit, which accounts for around 40% of a typical Business Reporting paper and can form the majority of Question 3 in Business Change. This book removes the need for you to prepare your own folder notes on risks and tests, leaving more time to invest in other aspects of Audit or the other TI subjects. All 70 Audit areas are arranged in alphabetical order, allowing quick reference. Where relevant, cross references between Audit areas are also included, giving you reminders and hints. Book can also be used in preparation for Professional Stage Audit & Assurance, helping you learn lists of tests for the crucial question on audit tests and procedures.
