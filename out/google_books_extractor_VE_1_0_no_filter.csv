The selection of the title, Environmental Modeling and Health Risk Analysis stems from an ambitious objective of providing a review of air, surface water and groundwater quality modeling topics and linking these models with exposure and health risk analysis. Thus, the purpose is to provide the reader with an integrated perspective on these two seemingly distant fields. The ACTS and RISK software that is an integral part of this book include computational platforms for all models discussed in the book. Using these two software tools, available from http://extras.springer.com/ , the models described in the book can be readily accessed and used in classroom or professional applications as demonstrated in the book.","2010-07-28","http://books.google.es/books?id=xRV6FFW4qlQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api","9048186080",

Basic Concepts provides the introduction to the concepts, techniques, and practical examples to guide both young and experienced practitioners and academics in the fascinating, but complex world of risk modelling.

"Risk Perceptions, Risk Preferences, Risk Ambiguity, and Flood Insurance","intitle:risk",,"[Flood insurance]","This thesis presents an analysis of subjective risk information and participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Data are taken from a survey of residents in flood-prone coastal regions in the southeastern U.S. Regression models are constructed to better understand factors affecting individuals' perceived risk ambiguity related to flood risk and the role of risk preferences, risk perceptions, and especially risk ambiguity, on the decision to purchase flood insurance. This is the first study not only of the influence of risk ambiguity on NFIP participation, but also of the impact of using different risk perception measures. Results indicate that NFIP participation is significantly affected by mean perceived risk, but the influence of range/variance of perceived risk, which presents one's perceived ambiguity, is mixed.","2012","http://books.google.es/books?id=xJk-nQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","OCLC:806515412",

"Market Risk Analysis, Value at Risk Models","intitle:risk","[Carol Alexander]","[Business & Economics]","Written by leading market risk academic, Professor Carol Alexander, Value-at-Risk Models forms part four of the Market Risk Analysis four volume set. Building on the three previous volumes this book provides by far the most comprehensive, rigorous and detailed treatment of market VaR models. It rests on the basic knowledge of financial mathematics and statistics gained from Volume I, of factor models, principal component analysis, statistical models of volatility and correlation and copulas from Volume II and, from Volume III, knowledge of pricing and hedging financial instruments and of mapping portfolios of similar instruments to risk factors. A unifying characteristic of the series is the pedagogical approach to practical examples that are relevant to market risk analysis in practice. All together, the Market Risk Analysis four volume set illustrates virtually every concept or formula with a practical, numerical example or a longer, empirical case study. Across all four volumes there are approximately 300 numerical and empirical examples, 400 graphs and figures and 30 case studies many of which are contained in interactive Excel spreadsheets available from the the accompanying CD-ROM . Empirical examples and case studies specific to this volume include: Parametric linear value at risk (VaR)models: normal, Student t and normal mixture and their expected tail loss (ETL); New formulae for VaR based on autocorrelated returns; Historical simulation VaR models: how to scale historical VaR and volatility adjusted historical VaR; Monte Carlo simulation VaR models based on multivariate normal and Student t distributions, and based on copulas; Examples and case studies of numerous applications to interest rate sensitive, equity, commodity and international portfolios; Decomposition of systematic VaR of large portfolios into standard alone and marginal VaR components; Backtesting and the assessment of risk model risk; Hypothetical factor push and historical stress tests, and stress testing based on VaR and ETL.","2009-01-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=e03cHzItv0AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=56&source=gbs_api","9780470745076",

"An Analysis of Transfer Risk in Comparison to Sovereign Risk","intitle:risk","[Philipp Hauger]","[Business & Economics]","Transfer risk is the risk that a non-sovereign entity, which is able and willing to service its foreign currency obligations, cannot obtain the required currency or cannot transfer this money to the receiver abroad. This transfer inability is caused by the imposition of restrictions on convertibility or capital transfers by the government. Transfer risk applies to all types of international investments, especially in emerging market countries. Due to this, it is more important than ever in these days of globalization. The New Basel Capital Accords require the consideration of transfer risk, too. The author Philipp Hauger describes the different types of risk occurring in international borrowings and investments. The political and corporate determinants of transfer risk are examined. The book illustrates the reasons why monetary unions reduce the risk of a transfer event, even though they have no influence on the sovereign risk. In addition, the author details how transfer risk is assessed by international professionals and describes two interesting approaches to estimate transfer risk in a quantitative way. This book is intended for professionals and students who are interested in the risks of international investments and for everybody working in international business, who has to differentiate between sovereign risk and the risk of a corporate default.","2006-10-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=l0NPQM46vFIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=65&source=gbs_api","9783638559454",

"The Rhetoric of Risk. Technical Documentation in Hazardous Environments","intitle:risk","[Beverly A. Sauer]","[TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING]","The crash of an Amtrak train near Baltimore, the collapse of the Hyatt hotel in Kansas City, the incident at Three Mile Island, and other large-scale technological disasters have provided powerful examples of the ways that communication practices influence the events and decisions that precipitate a disaster. These examples have raised ethical questions about the responsibility of writers within agencies, epistemological questions about the nature of representation in science, and rhetorical questions about the nature of expertise and experience as grounds for judgments about risk. In The Rhetoric of Risk: Technical Documentation in Hazardous Environments, author Beverly Sauer examines how the dynamic uncertainty of the material environment affects communication in large regulatory industries. Sauer's analysis focuses specifically on mine safety, which provides a rich technical and historical context where problems of rhetorical agency, narrative, and the negotiation of meaning have visible and tragic outcomes. But the questions Sauer asks have larger implication for risk and safety: How does writing function in large regulatory industries? What can we learn from experience? Why is this experience so difficult to capture in writing? What information is lost when agencies rely on written documentation alone? Given the uncertainties, how can we work to improve communication in hazardous and uncertain environments? By exploring how individuals make sense of the material, technical, and institutional indeterminancies of their work in speech and gesture, The Rhetoric of Risk helps communicators rethink their frequently unquestioned assumptions about workplace discourse and the role of writers in hazardous worksites. It is intended for scholars and students in technical writing and communication, rhetoric, risk analysis and risk communication, as well as a wide range of engineering and technical fields concerned with risk, safety, and uncertainty.","2003-01-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=MpEAoMcFNJ8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=85&source=gbs_api","9781135654870",

Attention is devoted to the regulative frameworks implemented to guarantee the safety of the food chain against the BSE menace and at the liability responses sketched to compensate the victims of mad cow disease, showing how both these elements have been influenced by the cultural context within which they place themselves.","2009-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=6sfjuoN8zZ0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=89&source=gbs_api","0754678113",

"At Risk. Natural Hazards, People's Vulnerability and Disasters","intitle:risk","[Benjamin Wisner]","[Science]","The term 'natural disaster' is often used to refer to natural events such as earthquakes, hurricanes or floods. However, the phrase 'natural disaster' suggests an uncritical acceptance of a deeply engrained ideological and cultural myth. At Risk questions this myth and argues that extreme natural events are not disasters until a vulnerable group of people is exposed. The updated new edition confronts a further ten years of ever more expensive and deadly disasters and discusses disaster not as an aberration, but as a signal failure of mainstream 'development'. Two analytical models are provided as tools for understanding vulnerability. One links remote and distant 'root causes' to 'unsafe conditions' in a 'progression of vulnerability'. The other uses the concepts of 'access' and 'livelihood' to understand why some households are more vulnerable than others. Examining key natural events and incorporating strategies to create a safer world, this revised edition is an important resource for those involved in the fields of environment and development studies.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=qMmvGH1Ce64C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=102&source=gbs_api","0415252156",

"Racial Identity, Masculinity and Homosexuality in the Lives of Young Black Men who Have Sex with Men: Implications for HIV Risk","intitle:risk","[Errol Lamont Fields]",,"Background. Young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) carry a disparate burden of HIV infection. A recent study reports an HIV prevalence of 16% among young Black MSM 15-22 compared to 6.9% in Latino MSM and 3.3% in white MSM in 7 urban centers (Harawa et al., 2004). Moreover, although rates of unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) are similar, young Black MSM in these settings have an odds ratio of HIV infection that is 9 times that of young white MSM (Harawa et al., 2004). The similar rates of UAI across racial and ethnic groups suggest a need to examine other, more complex factors. Accordingly, this study explores multiple disciplines and theoretical concepts that may be pertinent to HIV risk in this population including identity and identity development, social norms and normative influence, and theories of masculinity and gender role conflict.","2009","http://books.google.es/books?id=YJhoKwODS-8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=116&source=gbs_api","1109139152",
"On the Feasibility of TBM Drives in Squeezing Ground and the Risk of Shield Jamming","intitle:risk","[Marco Ramoni]","[Drilling and boring machinery]","Squeezing ground represents a challenging operating environment as it may slow down or obstruct TBM operation. Due to the geometrical constraints of the equipment, relatively small convergences of 10-20 cm may lead to considerable difficulties in the machine area (sticking of the cutter head, jamming of the shield) or in the back-up area (e.g., jamming of the back-up equipment, inadmissible convergences of the bored profile, damage to the tunnel support). Depending on the number and the length of the critical stretches, squeezing conditions may even call into question the feasibility of a TBM drive. On account of this, and bearing in mind the steady increase in the number of tunnels excavated with TBMs through so-called ""difficult ground conditions"", the topic investigated in this PhD thesis is of great practical relevance.Based upon case histories reported in the literature, Part I sets out firstly to give an overview of the specific problems of TBM tunnelling under squeezing conditions. Part II presents a computational model which simulates accurately and efficiently the advancing TBM and the installed tunnel support in one single computational step applying the so-called ""steady state method"". Part III advances a number of theory-based decision aids, which will support rapid, initial assessments to be made of thrust force requirements. Part IV investigates the complex problem of the interaction between the advancing TBM, the consolidating ground and the lining. Emphasis is thereby placed on the effect of the gross advance rate and the effect of ground permeability on shield loading during regular TBM operation (the boring process including short standstills) and during a long standstill.","2010","http://books.google.es/books?id=3eJkqtZ2CwcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=117&source=gbs_api","9783728133632",
"Risk Savvy. How To Make Good Decisions","intitle:risk","[Gerd Gigerenzer]","[Self-Help]","A fascinating, practical guide to making better decisions with our money, health and personal lives from Gerd Gigerenzer, the author of Reckoning with Risk. Risk-taking is essential for innovation, fun, and the courage to face the uncertainties in life. Yet for many important decisions, we're often presented with statistics and probabilities that we don't really understand and we inevitably rely on experts in the relevant fields - policy makers, financial advisors, doctors - to analyse and choose for us. But what if they don't quite understand the way the information is presented either? How do we make sure we're asking doctors the right questions about proposed treatment? Is there a rule of thumb that could help choose the right partner? This entertaining book shows us how to recognize when we don't have all the information and know what to do about it. Gerd Gigerenzer looks at examples from every aspect of life to identify the reasons for our collective misunderstanding of the risks we face. He shows how we can all use simple rules to avoid being manipulated into unrealistic fears or hopes, to make better-informed decisions, and to learn to understand risk and uncertainty in our own lives. 'Gigerenzer is brilliant and his topic is fabulous' Steven Pinker 'Catchily optimistic and slyly funny' Guardian Gerd Gigerenzer is Director of the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin and former Professor of Psychology at the University of Chicago. He is the author of several books on heuristics and decision making, including Reckoning with Risk.","2014-04-17","http://books.google.es/books?id=nQxPAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=118&source=gbs_api","9780141970110",
