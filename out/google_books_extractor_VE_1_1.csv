Aral]","[Science]","This book is intended to serve as a comprehensive source for the advancements and contributions made in environmental transformation and transport modeling in general and the associated health risk assessment topics in particular. The selection of the title, Environmental Modeling and Health Risk Analysis stems from an ambitious objective of providing a review of air, surface water and groundwater quality modeling topics and linking these models with exposure and health risk analysis. Thus, the purpose is to provide the reader with an integrated perspective on these two seemingly distant fields. The ACTS and RISK software that is an integral part of this book include computational platforms for all models discussed in the book. Using these two software tools, available from http://extras.springer.com/ , the models described in the book can be readily accessed and used in classroom or professional applications as demonstrated in the book.","2010-07-28","http://books.google.es/books?id=xRV6FFW4qlQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","9048186080",
"Credit Risk Management: Basic Concepts: Financial Risk Components, Rating Analysis, Models, Economic and Regulatory Capital","intitle:risk","[Tony Van Gestel, Bart Baesens]","[Business & Economics]","Credit Risk Management: Basic Concepts is the first book of a series of three with the objective of providing an overview of all aspects, steps, and issues that should be considered when undertaking credit risk management, including the Basel II Capital Accord, which all major banks must comply with in 2008. The introduction of the recently suggested Basel II Capital Accord has raised many issues and concerns about how to appropriately manage credit risk. Managing credit risk is one of the next big challenges facing financial institutions. The importance and relevance of efficiently managing credit risk is evident from the huge investments that many financial institutions are making in this area, the booming credit industry in emerging economies (e.g. Brazil, China, India, ...), the many events (courses, seminars, workshops, ...) that are being organised on this topic, and the emergence of new academic journals and magazines in the field (e.g. Journal of Credit Risk, Journal of Risk Model Validation, Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions, ...). Basic Concepts provides the introduction to the concepts, techniques, and practical examples to guide both young and experienced practitioners and academics in the fascinating, but complex world of risk modelling. Financial risk management, an area of increasing importance with the recent Basel II developments, is discussed in terms of practical business impact and the increasing profitability competition, laying the foundation for books II and III.","2008-10-23","http://books.google.es/books?id=aXP7xjN5o00C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","0191609307",

"Risk Perceptions, Risk Preferences, Risk Ambiguity, and Flood Insurance","intitle:risk",,"[Flood insurance]","This thesis presents an analysis of subjective risk information and participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Data are taken from a survey of residents in flood-prone coastal regions in the southeastern U.S. Regression models are constructed to better understand factors affecting individuals' perceived risk ambiguity related to flood risk and the role of risk preferences, risk perceptions, and especially risk ambiguity, on the decision to purchase flood insurance. This is the first study not only of the influence of risk ambiguity on NFIP participation, but also of the impact of using different risk perception measures. Results indicate that NFIP participation is significantly affected by mean perceived risk, but the influence of range/variance of perceived risk, which presents one's perceived ambiguity, is mixed.","2012","http://books.google.es/books?id=xJk-nQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api","OCLC:806515412",

"Market Risk Analysis, Value at Risk Models","intitle:risk","[Carol Alexander]","[Business & Economics]","Written by leading market risk academic, Professor Carol Alexander, Value-at-Risk Models forms part four of the Market Risk Analysis four volume set. Building on the three previous volumes this book provides by far the most comprehensive, rigorous and detailed treatment of market VaR models. It rests on the basic knowledge of financial mathematics and statistics gained from Volume I, of factor models, principal component analysis, statistical models of volatility and correlation and copulas from Volume II and, from Volume III, knowledge of pricing and hedging financial instruments and of mapping portfolios of similar instruments to risk factors. A unifying characteristic of the series is the pedagogical approach to practical examples that are relevant to market risk analysis in practice. All together, the Market Risk Analysis four volume set illustrates virtually every concept or formula with a practical, numerical example or a longer, empirical case study. Across all four volumes there are approximately 300 numerical and empirical examples, 400 graphs and figures and 30 case studies many of which are contained in interactive Excel spreadsheets available from the the accompanying CD-ROM . Empirical examples and case studies specific to this volume include: Parametric linear value at risk (VaR)models: normal, Student t and normal mixture and their expected tail loss (ETL); New formulae for VaR based on autocorrelated returns; Historical simulation VaR models: how to scale historical VaR and volatility adjusted historical VaR; Monte Carlo simulation VaR models based on multivariate normal and Student t distributions, and based on copulas; Examples and case studies of numerous applications to interest rate sensitive, equity, commodity and international portfolios; Decomposition of systematic VaR of large portfolios into standard alone and marginal VaR components; Backtesting and the assessment of risk model risk; Hypothetical factor push and historical stress tests, and stress testing based on VaR and ETL.","2009-01-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=e03cHzItv0AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=58&source=gbs_api","9780470745076",

"An Analysis of Transfer Risk in Comparison to Sovereign Risk","intitle:risk","[Philipp Hauger]","[Business & Economics]","Transfer risk is the risk that a non-sovereign entity, which is able and willing to service its foreign currency obligations, cannot obtain the required currency or cannot transfer this money to the receiver abroad. This transfer inability is caused by the imposition of restrictions on convertibility or capital transfers by the government. Transfer risk applies to all types of international investments, especially in emerging market countries. Due to this, it is more important than ever in these days of globalization. The New Basel Capital Accords require the consideration of transfer risk, too. The author Philipp Hauger describes the different types of risk occurring in international borrowings and investments. The political and corporate determinants of transfer risk are examined. The book illustrates the reasons why monetary unions reduce the risk of a transfer event, even though they have no influence on the sovereign risk. In addition, the author details how transfer risk is assessed by international professionals and describes two interesting approaches to estimate transfer risk in a quantitative way. This book is intended for professionals and students who are interested in the risks of international investments and for everybody working in international business, who has to differentiate between sovereign risk and the risk of a corporate default.","2006-10-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=l0NPQM46vFIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api","9783638559454",

First, it takes a decidedly global approach-an essential ingredient for any comprehensive work on market risk. Second, it ties the scientifically grounded, yet intuitively appealing, VaR measure to earlier, more idiosyncratic measures of market risk that are used in specific market environs (e.g., duration in fixed income). Finally, it encompasses all of the accepted approaches to calculating a VaR measure and presents them in a clearly explained fashion with supporting illustrations and completely worked-out examples."" -from the Foreword by John F. Marshall, PhD, Principal, Marshall, Tucker & Associates, LLC ""Measuring Market Risk with Value at Risk offers a much-needed intellectual bridge, a translation from the esoteric realm of mathematical finance to the domain of financial managers who seek guidance in applying developments from this important field of research as well as that of MBA-level graduate instruction.

A comprehensive review of available biological and biophysical data supports a ""linear-no-threshold"" (LNT) risk model?that the risk of cancer proceeds in a linear fashion at lower doses without a threshold and that the smallest dose has the potential to cause a small increase in risk to humans.

"Acceptable Risks. Politics, Policy, and Risky Technologies","intitle:risks","[C. F. Larry Heimann]","[Political Science]","DIVComplex and risky technologies--technologies such as new drugs for the treatment of AIDS that promise great benefits to our society but carry significant risks--pose many problems for political leaders and the policy makers responsible for overseeing them. Public agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration are told by political superiors not to inhibit important technological advances and may even be charged with promoting such development but must also make sure that no major accidents occur under their watch. Given the large costs associated with catastrophic accidents, the general public and elected officials often demand reliable or failure-free management of these technologies and have little tolerance for the error. /divDIVResearch in this area has lead to a schism between those who argue that it is possible to have reliable management techniques and safely manage complex technologies and others who contend that such control is difficult at best. In this book C. F. Larry Heimann advances an important solution to this problem by developing a general theory of organizational reliability and agency decision making. The book looks at both external and internal influences on reliability in agency decision making. It then tests theoretical propositions developed in a comparative case study of two agencies involved with the handling of risky technologies: NASA and the manned space flight program and the FDA's handling of pharmaceuticals--particularly new AIDS therapies. /divDIVDrawing on concepts from engineering, organizational theory, political science, and decision theory, this book will be of interest to those interested in science and technology policy, bureaucratic management and reform, as well as those interested in health and space policy. /divDIVC.

The analysis is based on the simultaneous quotations of premiums for the twenty-two groups of destinations which formed a major part of the commerical matrix of the Netherlands. It considers the operation of the market at two levels. On the one hand, the provision of insurance responded to risk uncertainties in the market: in the 1760s and 1770s, Amsterdam experienced three serious unheavals, in the form of the financial crises of 1763 and 1772-73 and the hostilities leading to American independence and the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. On the other hand, underwriters accepted risks in situations of structural uncertainty. The book is fully illustrated with graphs and maps and uses a wide range of original documents drawn from archives and libraries in Europe. An appendix provides the basic data of premiums quoted in the price-lists of the market.","2002-07-04","http://books.google.es/books?id=kDEMG3ZrseUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=60&source=gbs_api","0521893879",

"Main Types of Political Risks Experienced by MNEs","intitle:risks","[Svenja Martina Gnosa]",,"Essay from the year 2011 in the subject Business economics - Marketing, Corporate Communication, CRM, Market Research, Social Media, grade: 1,3, University of St Andrews (School of Management), language: English, abstract: Identify the main types of political risk encountered by multinational corporations and discuss how these risks can be minimized. Introduction The controversy between the Kazak government and the Italian oil company ENI about the exploitation of Kashagans oil fields is only one out of many cases, in which political violence acts or governmental decisions threatened foreign investments of a multinational enterprise (MNE). In April 2006, the Dacion and Jusepin oil fields, operated by ENI and the French company Total, were taken over by the Venezuelan government, because they rejected to change their business operations into joint ventures with the state-owned oil company PDVSA (Ferrari and Rolfini 2008). Stated by Kesternich and Schnitzer (2009) some recent empirical studies identified that for MNEs political risk is one of the most important factors when considering a foreign investment. Foreign investments nowadays seem to be even more risky in terms of pollution that result in natural catastrophes such as caused by BP (Heller 2011), cultural conflicts or political disturbances for which Lybia (Yang 2011) represents a recent example and an increasing social disparity (Bloch, Koepplinger and Wolfrum 2007) [...]","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=2d5tZ9ZqG4QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api","9783640961757",

"Automobile Insurance: Road Safety, New Drivers, Risks, Insurance Fraud and Regulation. Road Safety, New Drivers, Risks, Insurance Fraud and Regulation","intitle:risks","[Georges Dionne, Claire Laberge-Nadeau]","[Business & Economics]","Motor vehicle accidents are still a leading cause of death, even if the trend has somewhat declined over the past 20 years. Indeed, motor vehicle accidents are a significant cause of death in comparison with air and space transport accidents, homicides and even HIV infections, causes which are more often highlighted in the media. As shown in this book, motor vehicle accidents are particularly damaging to very young drivers. The assessment of driving risks is a common concern for road transportation safety and the automobile insurance industry. In both cases, there is an awareness of the great losses resulting from the deaths, injuries and property damage caused by traffic accidents. Research is essential to counteract this public health threat, to assess the success or failure of countermeasures, and to solve the problems it generates in the insurance industry. This book is for people concerned about road crashes (prevention and compensation) and about the insurance problems they pose - namely private and public institutional authorities, consultants, administrators, practitioners, and researchers interested in sharing the authors' experience in this domain. The book presents original contributions related to motor vehicle insurance and road safety. All papers have been evaluated by external referees. Four subjects are covered: 1) Automobile Insurance Pricing, Risks and Asymmetric Information; 2) Insurance Fraud; 3) Young Drivers: Licensing Policies, Evaluation and Risks; and 4) Road Insurance Regulation.","1999","http://books.google.es/books?id=CoyOr5uvyBwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api","079238394X",

"Safety, Reliability and Risks Associated with Water, Oil and Gas Pipelines","intitle:risks","[Guy Pluvinage, Mohamed Hamdy Elwany]","[Technology & Engineering]","Pipes are of major importance for transport of liquids and gas mainly for water, natural gas and oil. The total length of gas pipes in the world is estimated at one million kilometres for gas transport (pipes with a diameter of 80 to 1000 mm). Pipelines remain the least expensive transcontinental mean of transport compared to rail-bound or terrestrial transport. It has become increasingly paramount to ensure the safe utilisation of such plant in order to prevent economical, social and ecological losses. From a technical point of view, pipelines are complicated three dimensional structures that include straight pipes, nozzles, pipe-bends, dissimilar welded joints, etc. In addition, their operating conditions can be quite severe, that is, internal pressure and cyclic loading (vibration) combined with the influence of internal and external corrosive environments. The external defects, e.g., corrosion defects, gouge, foreign object scratches, and pipeline erection activities are major failure reasons of gas pipelines. All these types of defects and associated failure are described. Leak and fracture of pipes is assumed to be done by initiation and propagation of defect and final failure when defect has reached a critical length. In this book, the three two major defect assessment tools for pipes are presented : i) the failure assessment diagram and particularly the SINTAP procedure, ii) limit analysis, iii) strain design approach Methods of defect repair are based on investigation findings. Methods such as welded sleeve, repair clamp composite sleeve, grinding, pipe replacement are described.","2007-10-25","http://books.google.es/books?id=WV4c-HpDh5EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=68&source=gbs_api","9781402065248",

Private and public sector organisations increasingly devote resources to risk prevention and contingency planning to manage risk events should they occur. This 2010 book shows how we can organise our social, organisational and regulatory policy systems to cope better with the array of local and transnational risks we regularly encounter. Contributors from a range of disciplines - including finance, history, law, management, political science, social psychology, sociology and disaster studies - consider threats, vulnerabilities and insecurities alongside social and organisational sources of resilience and security. These issues are introduced and discussed through a fascinating and diverse set of topics, including myxomatosis, the 2012 Olympic Games, gene therapy and the financial crisis.

Can God be in control of anything at all if he is not constantly in control of everything? John Sanders says yes to both of these questions. In The God Who Risks defends his answer with a careful and challenging argument. He first builds his case on an in-depth reading of the Old and New Testaments. Then Sanders probes philosophical, historical and systematic theology for further support. And he completes his defense with considerations drawn from practical theology. The God Who Risks is a profound and often inspiring presentation of ""relational theism""--an understanding of providence in which ""a personal God enters into genuine give-and-take relations with his creatures."" With this book Sanders not only contributes to serious theological discussion but also enlightens pastors and laypersons who struggle with questions about suffering, evil and human free will.","2009-08-20","http://books.google.es/books?id=IYJSqRMoGYYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=74&source=gbs_api","0830878076",

"Risks, Reputations, and Rewards. Contingency Fee Legal Practice in the United States","intitle:risks","[Herbert M. Kritzer]","[Law]","Risks, Reputations, and Rewards looks at a variety of interrelated questions about contingency fee legal practice: What is the nature of the contingency fees that lawyers charge? How do lawyers get and screen potential cases? How do contingency fee lawyers interact with their clients and opponents? What is involved in settling these cases? What types of returns do contingency fee cases produce? And what role does reputation play in contingency fee practice? The author argues that to be successful, contingency fee lawyers must generate a portfolio of cases, similar to an investment portfolio with its associated risk. This has a significant impact on how contingency fee lawyers obtain and select cases, manage their work, and deal with the pressures that arise in settling cases.

Stewart]","[Technology & Engineering]","In seeking to evaluate the efficacy of post-9/11 homeland security expenses--which have risen by more than a trillion dollars, not including war costs--the common query has been, ""Are we safer?"" This, however, is the wrong question. Of course we are ""safer""--the posting of a single security guard at one building's entrance enhances safety. The correct question is, ""Are any gains in security worth the funds expended?"" In this engaging, readable book, John Mueller and Mark Stewart apply risk and cost-benefit evaluation techniques to answer this very question. This analytical approach has been used throughout the world for decades by regulators, academics, and businesses--but, as a recent National Academy of Science study suggests, it has never been capably applied by the people administering homeland security funds. Given the limited risk terrorism presents, expenses meant to lower it have for the most part simply not been worth it. For example, to be considered cost-effective, increased American homeland security expenditures would have had each year to have foiled up to 1,667 attacks roughly like the one intended on Times Square in 2010--more than four a day. Cataloging the mistakes that the US has made--and continues to make--in managing homeland security programs, Terror, Security, and Money has the potential to redirect our efforts toward a more productive and far more cost-effective course.","2011-09-09","http://books.google.es/books?id=jyYGL2jZBC4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks&hl=&cd=79&source=gbs_api","9780199912285",

"Risk and Culture. An Essay on the Selection of Technological and Environmental Dangers","risk","[Mary Douglas, Aaron Wildavsky]","[Nature]","With flair and scholarly acumen, British anthropologist Mary Douglas (Purity and Danger) and Berkeley political scientist Aaron Wildavsky (Speaking Truth to Power) apply the yardstick of cultural bias to American society - and attack scientific objectivity, in the bargain. What is it, they ask, that Americans fear? Why have we, above all other modern societies, fostered strong environmental groups, concerned with single issues (like the building of a nuclear-power plant next door), as well as with the technological threat to planetary survival? Their answers derive from cultural analysis of nomadic groups, of isolated communities like the Hutterites or the Amish, and of contemporary American society itself. Each culture, each community, the authors aver, has its pollution beliefs, connecting certain actions to disasters (e.g., the woman's adultery causes the child to die). To deny the involvement of personal, moral, and political values is absurd. Yet in appeals to science, to risk-assessment analysis, Americans pretend that their fears are rational. Building their argument in early chapters that deal with fear, risk, and scientific disagreement, the pair then develop parallels between America today and pre-modern cultures, singling out three common ways that groups in society are structured. There is the centrist hierarchy, exemplified by a bureaucracy with stability and resistance to change. There is the individualist economic model, also centrist, that allows persons to move and compete for gain or loss in the market. And there is the sectarian border, composed of egalitarian voluntary groups united by a common doctrine - usually a transcendent religious or moral precept - critical of the center. For example, the Sierra Club tends to be hierarchical, while Friends of the Earth and the Clamshell Alliance are sectarian. Douglas & Wildavsky suggest a variety of reasons for the post-WW II growth of environmentalist groups: more college-educated affluent citizens, the increase of service jobs, the civil rights movement, mistrust after Vietnam and Watergate. And in their closing chapters, they describe the inherent inconsistency of centrist and border groups, not to mention their self-destructive qualities, should any achieve their goals. Though some of the central chapters pursue abstract arguments to the neglect of concretions, the authors' summation of issues, their argument that one should always look for the hidden rules governing a vision of the good life, and their plea for resiliency in response to risk are all sound and stimulating. Admirers of Mary Douglas' Purity and Danger will not be disappointed.

During the last two decades, the dangers highlighted by Beck have taken on new forms and assumed ever greater significance. Terrorism has shifted to a global arena, financial crises have produced worldwide consequences that are difficult to control and politicians have been forced to accept that climate change is not idle speculation. In short, we have come to see that today we live in a world at risk. A new feature of our world risk society is that risk is produced for political gain. This political use of risk means that fear creeps into modern life. A need for security encroaches on our liberty and our view of equality. However, Beck is anything but an alarmist and believes that the anticipation of catastrophe can fundamentally change global politics. We have the opportunity today to reconfigure power in terms of what Beck calls a 'cosmopolitan material politics.

"The Great Risk Shift : The Assault on American Jobs, Families, Health Care and Retirement And How You Can Fight Back. The Assault on American Jobs, Families, Health Care and Retirement And How You Can Fight Back","risk","[Jacob S. Hacker Professor of Political Science Yale University]","[Political Science]","America's leaders say the economy is strong and getting stronger. But ordinary Americans aren't buying it. They see what the rosy statistics hide: We are all struggling under the weight of terrifying economic instability. No matter how well educated and hard working we are, we know that the bottom can fall out at any moment. Meanwhile, the safety net that once protected us is fast unraveling. With retirement plans in growing jeopardy while health coverage erodes, more and more economic risk is shifting from government and business onto the fragile shoulders of the American family. In The Great Risk Shift, Jacob S. Hacker lays bare this unsettling new economic climate, showing how it has come about, what it is doing to our families, and how we can fight back. Behind this shift, he contends, is the Personal Responsibility Crusade, eagerly embraced by corporate leaders and Republican politicians who speak of a nirvana of economic empowerment, an ""ownership society"" in which Americans are free to choose. But as Hacker reveals, the result has been quite different: a harsh new world of economic insecurity, in which far too many Americans are free to lose. The book documents how two great pillars of economic security--the family and the workplace--guarantee far less financial stability than they once did. The final leg of economic support--the public and private benefits that workers and families get when economic disaster strikes--has dangerously eroded as political leaders and corporations increasingly cut back protections of our health care, our income security, and our retirement pensions. Hacker concludes by advocating an ""insurance and opportunity society"" that would safeguard economic security and expand economic opportunity, ensuring that all Americans have the basic financial security they need to reach for and achieve the American Dream. Jacob Hacker brings into focus as never before the pressures that the Great Risk Shift exerts on our pocketbooks and on our lives. Blending powerful human stories, big-picture analysis, and compelling ideas for reform, this remarkable volume will hit a nerve, serving as a rallying point in the vital struggle for economic security in an increasingly uncertain world.","2006-10-09","http://books.google.es/books?id=2k_zwHl3PAAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","9780199726639",

"The Rhetoric of Risk. Technical Documentation in Hazardous Environments","risk","[Beverly A. Sauer]","[TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING]","The crash of an Amtrak train near Baltimore, the collapse of the Hyatt hotel in Kansas City, the incident at Three Mile Island, and other large-scale technological disasters have provided powerful examples of the ways that communication practices influence the events and decisions that precipitate a disaster. These examples have raised ethical questions about the responsibility of writers within agencies, epistemological questions about the nature of representation in science, and rhetorical questions about the nature of expertise and experience as grounds for judgments about risk. In The Rhetoric of Risk: Technical Documentation in Hazardous Environments, author Beverly Sauer examines how the dynamic uncertainty of the material environment affects communication in large regulatory industries. Sauer's analysis focuses specifically on mine safety, which provides a rich technical and historical context where problems of rhetorical agency, narrative, and the negotiation of meaning have visible and tragic outcomes. But the questions Sauer asks have larger implication for risk and safety: How does writing function in large regulatory industries? What can we learn from experience? Why is this experience so difficult to capture in writing? What information is lost when agencies rely on written documentation alone? Given the uncertainties, how can we work to improve communication in hazardous and uncertain environments? By exploring how individuals make sense of the material, technical, and institutional indeterminancies of their work in speech and gesture, The Rhetoric of Risk helps communicators rethink their frequently unquestioned assumptions about workplace discourse and the role of writers in hazardous worksites. It is intended for scholars and students in technical writing and communication, rhetoric, risk analysis and risk communication, as well as a wide range of engineering and technical fields concerned with risk, safety, and uncertainty.","2003-01-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=MpEAoMcFNJ8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","9781135654870",

"Risk, Uncertainty and Profit","risk","[Frank H. Knight]","[Business & Economics]","One of the twentieth century's most influential economics texts, Risk, Uncertainty and Profit provided the theoretical basis of the entrepreneurial American economy during the post-industrial era. This revolutionary work taught the world how to systematically distinguish between risk (randomness with knowable probabilities), and uncertainty (randomness with unknowable probabilities), in order to accurately and properly ascertain a venture's potential profitability. Author Frank H. Knight's methodology served as the foundation of the Chicago School of Economics, maintaining that competition in a free market economy is the best method for achieving economic health. In this 1921 book, Knight explains why perfect competition would not necessarily eliminate profits, because of ""uncertainty,"" rather than ""risk."" He contends that even in long-run equilibrium, entrepreneurs would earn profits as a return for their toleration of uncertainty. Knight's reasoning remains valid in the twenty-first century, and his definitions of risk and uncertainty continue to be taught in modern economics classes. Sociologist Edward Shils declared Risk, Uncertainty and Profit ""a brilliant book,"" noting its interest not only to economists but also to social philosophers, sociologists, game theorists, and other specialists in social science.","2012-03-09","http://books.google.es/books?id=LFsVFS3OG_gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","9780486147932",

This book provides a comprehensive treatment of the theoretical concepts and modelling techniques of quantitative risk management and equips readers--whether financial risk analysts, actuaries, regulators, or students of quantitative finance--with practical tools to solve real-world problems. The authors cover methods for market, credit, and operational risk modelling; place standard industry approaches on a more formal footing; and describe recent developments that go beyond, and address main deficiencies of, current practice. The book's methodology draws on diverse quantitative disciplines, from mathematical finance through statistics and econometrics to actuarial mathematics. Main concepts discussed include loss distributions, risk measures, and risk aggregation and allocation principles. A main theme is the need to satisfactorily address extreme outcomes and the dependence of key risk drivers. The techniques required derive from multivariate statistical analysis, financial time series modelling, copulas, and extreme value theory. A more technical chapter addresses credit derivatives.

As a society, we are nervous of them, and consider them vulnerable, yet the seeds of successful and independent adult life are laid down in adolescence, and they need all the help and support that they can get at a challenging time. Adolescents at Risk: Against the Odds looks in depth at some of the key risks faced by adolescents, and at some of the ways in which they can be alleviated. The book is structured according to the operational challenges the research informs.","2007-12-17","http://books.google.es/books?id=548tCXJGljkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api","9780470025024",
"Adolescents and risk. Behaviors, functions and protective factors","risk","[Silvia Bonino, Elena Cattelino, Silvia Ciairano]","[Business & Economics]","The volume provides a substantial contribution to the understanding of adolescent risk behavior, informative and useful for both scientists and practitioners. The chapters deal with each of the key risk behaviors that are of concern at this developmental stage: tobacco smoking, alcohol use, marijuana and other drugs use, precocious and unprotected sexual behavior, eating disorders, risky behavior, risky driving, deviant and antisocial behavior. The book combines theoretical analysis and the findings of a wide research project, where the multiple contexts in the ecology of daily adolescent life have been considered. The data are based on large normative samples and the presentation of findings is very accessible, relying throughout on graphic representation rather than statistical tables. The book describes the different risk behaviors, shows the linkages between them, and explains the functions served by the various risk behaviors or the meanings they may have for the adolescent. It examines how they vary with age, sex, and other demographic characteristics, and demonstrates the influential role the theoretical risk factors and protective factors play in adolescent risk behavior involvement. The research findings not only strengthen the theory, but serve as an important guide to the design of intervention efforts to prevent or reduce adolescent involvement in risk behavior. The authors emphasize the need to strengthen protective factors that can promote positive development, and the need to provide opportunities for behaviors that can serve the same purposes as risk behaviors do, but without compromising health and development. This is the key challenge for all western contemporary societies.","2006-01-16","http://books.google.es/books?id=Bm0oNNvpAzAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api","9788847003934",
"Reporting on Risk. How the Mass Media Portray Accidents, Diseases, Other Hazards","risk","[Eleanor Singer, Phyliss M. Endreny]","[Business & Economics]","After acts of airline terrorism, air travel tends to drop dramaticallyyet Americans routinely pursue the far riskier business of driving cards, where accidents resulting in death or injury are much more likely to occur. Reporting on Risk argues that this selective concern with danger is powerfully shaped by the media, whose coverage of potentially hazardous events is governed more by a need to excite the public than to inform it. Singer and Endreny survey a wide range of print and electronic media to provide an unprecedented look at how hundreds of different hazards are presented to the publicfrom toxic waste and food poisoning to cigarette smoking, from transportation accidents to famine, and from experimental surgery to communicable diseases. Their investigations raise thought-provoking questions about what the media tell us about modern risks, which hazards are covered and which ignored, and how the media determine when hazards should be considered risky. Are natural hazards reported differently than man-made hazards? Is greater emphasis placed on the potential benefits or the potential drawbacks of complex new technologies? Are journalists more concerned with reporting on unproven cures or informing the public about preventative measures? Do newspapers differ from magazines and television in their risk reporting practices? Reporting on Risk examines the accuracy and the amount of information we receive about our environment. It offers a critical perspective on how our perceptions of risk, as shaped by the media, may contribute to misguided individual and public choices for action and prevention in an increasingly complex world. The authors' probing assessment of how the media report a vast array of risks offers insights useful to journalists, policy analysts, risk specialists, legislators, and concerned citizens.","1993-05-18","http://books.google.es/books?id=rfwyIIGQpsEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api","0871548011",

Bielecki, Marek Rutkowski]","[Business & Economics]","The main objective of Credit Risk: Modeling, Valuation and Hedging is to present a comprehensive survey of the past developments in the area of credit risk research, as well as to put forth the most recent advancements in this field. An important aspect of this text is that it attempts to bridge the gap between the mathematical theory of credit risk and the financial practice, which serves as the motivation for the mathematical modeling studied in the book. Mathematical developments are presented in a thorough manner and cover the structural (value-of-the-firm) and the reduced (intensity-based) approaches to credit risk modeling, applied both to single and to multiple defaults. In particular, the book offers a detailed study of various arbitrage-free models of defaultable term structures with several rating grades.","2002-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=GC5zjZVthFEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api","3540675930",

"Embracing Risk. The Changing Culture of Insurance and Responsibility","risk","[Tom Baker, Jonathan Simon]","[Law]","For much of the twentieth century, industrialized nations addressed social problems, such as workers' compensation benefits and social welfare programs, in terms of spreading risk. But in recent years a new approach has emerged: using risk both as a way to conceive of and address social problems and as an incentive to reduce individual claims on collective resources. Embracing Risk explores this new approach from a variety of perspectives. The first part of the book focuses on the interplay between risk and insurance in various historical and social contexts. The second part examines how risk is used to govern fields outside the realm of insurance, from extreme sports to policing, mental health institutions, and international law. Offering an original approach to risk, insurance, and responsibility, the provocative and wide-ranging essays in Embracing Risk demonstrate that risk has moved well beyond its origins in the insurance trade to become a central organizing principle of social and cultural life.","2002-02-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=KfiPIwkX_dgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api","0226035182",

"Risk: A Very Short Introduction","risk","[Baruch Fischhoff, John Kadvany]","[Business & Economics]","Risks are everywhere. They come from many sources, including crime, diseases, accidents, terror, climate change, finance, and intimacy. They arise from our own acts and they are imposed on us. In this Very Short Introduction Fischhoff and Kadvany draw on both the sciences and humanities to show what all risks have in common. Do we care about losing money, health, reputation, or peace of mind? How much do we care about things happening now or in the future? To ourselves or to others? All risks require thinking hard about what matters to us before we make decisions about them based on past experience, scientific knowledge, and future uncertainties. Using conceptual frameworks such as decision theory and behavioural decision research, we examine the science and practice of creating measures of risk and look at how scientists apply probability by combining historical records, scientific theories, and expert judgement. Showing what science has learned about how people deal with risks, and applying these to diverse everyday examples, the authors demonstrate how we move from understanding a risk to making a choice in everyday life.","2011-05-26","http://books.google.es/books?id=KD_nEy-hVJAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api","9780199576203",

"Risk Analysis in Engineering. Techniques, Tools, and Trends","risk","[Mohammad Modarres]","[Technology & Engineering]","Based on the authors 20 years of teaching, Risk Analysis in Engineering: Techniques, Tools, and Trends presents an engineering approach to probabilistic risk analysis (PRA). It emphasizes methods for comprehensive PRA studies, including techniques for risk management. The author assumes little or no prior knowledge of risk analysis on the part of the student and provides the necessary mathematical and engineering foundations. The text relies heavily on, but is not limited to, examples from the nuclear industry, because that is where PRA techniques were first developed. Since PRA provides a best-estimate approach, the author pays special attention to explaining uncertainty characterization. The book begins with a description of the basic definitions and principles of risk, safety, and performance and presents the elements of risk analysis and their applications in engineering. After highlighting the methods for performing PRAs, the author describes how to assess and measure performance of the building blocks of PRAs, such as reliability of hardware subsystems, structures, components, human actions, and software. He covers methods of characterizing uncertainties and methods for propagating them through the PRA model to estimate uncertainties of the results. The book explores how to identify and rank important and sensitive contributors to the estimated risk using the PRA and performance assessment models. It also includes a description of risk acceptance criteria and the formal methods for making decisions related to risk management options and strategies. The book concludes with a brief review of the main aspects, issues, and methods of risk communication. Drawing on notes, homework problems, and exams from courses he has taught as well as feedback from his students, Professor Modarres provides a from-the-trenches method for teaching risk assessment for engineers. This is a textbook that is easy to use for students and professors alike.","2006-01-13","http://books.google.es/books?id=ErjFzRWSne8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","1574447947",
"Children at Risk. The Precarious State of Children's Well-Being in America","risk","[Janice Shaw Crouse]","[Social Science]","The desire for our children to be free from want and danger and to be able to enjoy their youth in innocence would seem to be universal. Conventional wisdom says that parents in every socio-economic level of society share the dream of preserving their children's innocence. All want to provide a childhood and adolescence that shelters and protects children from the harshness of life and nurtures them until they are able to withstand the onslaught of reality. One need only look at troubled areas of the world, such as Northern Ireland, parts of the Middle East, or any number of other points on the globe, to see how weak is any communion forged out of these universal desires for the welfare of children. Even in the United States, the competition of ideas and values about what represents the ""good"" society in which to raise our children is fierce-as are differing views about the value of innocence and even life itself. These differing ideas and values affect people's actions even when they have never reflected on them, or have never cared enough to formulate those values into a coherent worldview. Crouse contends that without morals, children are at risk. Moral boundaries, not moral relativism, provide a safe haven for children by preserving their innocence and protecting them from predators and pedophiles. When authentic religious faith has been quashed, children are no longer safe. When the underlying values are wrong, when there are no common values unifying a people, even the best programs and most honorable of intentions are doomed to failure. Well-intentioned programs and policies inevitably fail miserably without an undergirding moral foundation, as is documented by an abundance of data and the social trends in America today.","2011-12-31","http://books.google.es/books?id=OrVycYAb-U0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api","1412815193",

Its use has swept the banking world and is now accepted as an essential tool in any risk manager's briefcase. Perhaps the greatest strength of VAR is that it can cope with virtually all financial products, from simple securities through to complex exotic derivatives. This allows the risk taken, across diverse trading activities, to be compared. This said, VAR is no panacea. It is as critical to understand when the use of VAR is inappropriate as it is to understand the value VAR can add to a bank's understanding and control of its risks. This book aims to explain how VAR can be used as an integral part of a risk and business management framework, rather than as a stand-alone tool. The objectives of this book are to explain: What VAR is - and isn't! How to calculate VAR - the three main methods Why stress testing is needed to complement VAR How to make stress testing effective How to use VAR and stress testing to manage risk How to use VAR to improve a bank's performance VAR as a regulatory measure of risk and capital Risk management practitioners, general bank managers, consultants and students of finance and risk management will find this book, and the software package included, an invaluable addition to their library.

"Organizational Encounters with Risk","risk","[Bridget Hutter, Michael Power]","[Business & Economics]","Organizational encounters with risk range from errors and anomalies to outright disasters. In a world of increasing interdependence and technological sophistication, the problem of understanding and managing such risks has grown ever more complex. Organizations and their participants must often reform and reorganise themselves in response to major events and crises, dealing with the paradox of managing the potentially unmanageable. Organizational responses are influenced by many factors, such as the representational capacity of information systems and concerns with legal liability. In this 2005 collection, leading experts on risk management from a variety of disciplines address these complex features of organizational encounters with risk. They raise critical questions about how risk can be understood and conceived by organizations, and whether it can be 'managed' in any realistic sense at all. This book is an important reminder that the organisational management of risk involves much more than the cool application of statistical method.","2005-12-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=wIfAU5exEPQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk&hl=&cd=70&source=gbs_api","0521846803",

"Financial Risk Forecasting. The Theory and Practice of Forecasting Market Risk with Implementation in R and Matlab","risk","[Jon Danielsson]","[Business & Economics]","Financial Risk Forecasting is a complete introduction to practical quantitative risk management, with a focus on market risk. Derived from the authors teaching notes and years spent training practitioners in risk management techniques, it brings together the three key disciplines of finance, statistics and modeling (programming), to provide a thorough grounding in risk management techniques. Written by renowned risk expert Jon Danielsson, the book begins with an introduction to financial markets and market prices, volatility clusters, fat tails and nonlinear dependence. It then goes on to present volatility forecasting with both univatiate and multivatiate methods, discussing the various methods used by industry, with a special focus on the GARCH family of models. The evaluation of the quality of forecasts is discussed in detail. Next, the main concepts in risk and models to forecast risk are discussed, especially volatility, value-at-risk and expected shortfall. The focus is both on risk in basic assets such as stocks and foreign exchange, but also calculations of risk in bonds and options, with analytical methods such as delta-normal VaR and duration-normal VaR and Monte Carlo simulation. The book then moves on to the evaluation of risk models with methods like backtesting, followed by a discussion on stress testing. The book concludes by focussing on the forecasting of risk in very large and uncommon events with extreme value theory and considering the underlying assumptions behind almost every risk model in practical use  that risk is exogenous  and what happens when those assumptions are violated. Every method presented brings together theoretical discussion and derivation of key equations and a discussion of issues in practical implementation. Each method is implemented in both MATLAB and R, two of the most commonly used mathematical programming languages for risk forecasting with which the reader can implement the models illustrated in the book. The book includes four appendices. The first introduces basic concepts in statistics and financial time series referred to throughout the book. The second and third introduce R and MATLAB, providing a discussion of the basic implementation of the software packages. And the final looks at the concept of maximum likelihood, especially issues in implementation and testing. The book is accompanied by a website - www.financialriskforecasting.com  which features downloadable code as used in the book.","2011-04-18","http://books.google.es/books?id=fzjkjQcAULQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk&hl=&cd=74&source=gbs_api","9781119977100",

"The Psychology of Risk Taking Behavior","risk","[R.M.

The consequences of risk taking may be positive, or result in accidents and injuries, especially in traffic. The wealth of studies and theories (about 1000 references) is used to offer a cohesive, holistic view of risk motivation. The risk motivation theory is a dynamic state-trait model incorporating physiological, emotional and cognitive components of risk perception, processing and planning. If a deficit exists between desired and perceived risk, risk compensation behavior results. A feedback loop provides new information for the next perception-motivation-behavior process. Assumptions were tested and support was found with 120 subjects in a longitudinal study. The concepts and findings are discussed in relation to psychological theories and their meaning for our daily lives.","1994-04-28","http://books.google.es/books?id=rI4c24VTriEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk&hl=&cd=79&source=gbs_api","9780080867618",

"Calculated Risks. How to Know When Numbers Deceive You","risks",,"[Education]","At the beginning of the twentieth century, H. G. Wells predicted that statistical thinking would be as necessary for citizenship in a technological world as the ability to read and write. But in the twenty-first century, we are often overwhelmed by a baffling array of percentages and probabilities as we try to navigate in a world dominated by statistics. Cognitive scientist Gerd Gigerenzer says that because we haven't learned statistical thinking, we don't understand risk and uncertainty. In order to assess risk -- everything from the risk of an automobile accident to the certainty or uncertainty of some common medical screening tests -- we need a basic understanding of statistics. Astonishingly, doctors and lawyers don't understand risk any better than anyone else. Gigerenzer reports a study in which doctors were told the results of breast cancer screenings and then were asked to explain the risks of contracting breast cancer to a woman who received a positive result from a screening. The actual risk was small because the test gives many false positives. But nearly every physician in the study overstated the risk. Yet many people will have to make important health decisions based on such information and the interpretation of that information by their doctors. Gigerenzer explains that a major obstacle to our understanding of numbers is that we live with an illusion of certainty. Many of us believe that HIV tests, DNA fingerprinting, and the growing number of genetic tests are absolutely certain. But even DNA evidence can produce spurious matches. We cling to our illusion of certainty because the medical industry, insurance companies, investment advisers, and election campaigns have become purveyors of certainty, marketing it like a commodity. To avoid confusion, says Gigerenzer, we should rely on more understandable representations of risk, such as absolute risks. For example, it is said that a mammography screening reduces the risk of breast cancer by 25 percent. But in absolute risks, that means that out of every 1,000 women who do not participate in screening, 4 will die; while out of 1,000 women who do, 3 will die. A 25 percent risk reduction sounds much more significant than a benefit that 1 out of 1,000 women will reap. This eye-opening book explains how we can overcome our ignorance of numbers and better understand the risks we may be taking with our money, our health, and our lives.","2002","http://books.google.es/books?id=KJ7nrlJqcRYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risks&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","9780743254236",
"Risks and Wrongs","risks","[Jules L. Coleman]","[Philosophy]","This book by one of America's preeminent legal theorists is concerned with the conflict between the goals of justice and economic efficiency in the allocation of risk, especially risk pertaining to safety. The author approaches his subject from the premise that the market is central to liberal political, moral, and legal theory. In the first part of the book, he rejects traditional ""rational choice"" liberalism in favor of the view that the market operates as a rational way of fostering stable relationships and institutions within communities of individuals with broadly divergent conceptions of the good. However, markets are needed most where they are most difficult to create and sustain, and one way to understand contract law in liberal legal theory, according to Professor Coleman, is as an institution designed to reduce uncertainty and thereby make markets possible. Another target of this book is the prevalent view that tort law helps rectify market failures when transaction costs are too high to permit contracting. The author argues instead that tort law should be understood as a way of rectifying wrongful losses not inefficient exchanges.","1992","http://books.google.es/books?id=Afc3AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=risks&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","0521428610",

"The Regulatory Craft. Controlling Risks, Solving Problems, and Managing Compliance","risks","[Malcolm K. Sparrow]","[Political Science]","The Regulatory Craft tackles one of the most pressing public policy issues of our time?the reform of regulatory and enforcement practice. Malcolm K. Sparrow shows how the vogue prescriptions for reform (centered on concepts of customer service and process improvement) fail to take account of the distinctive character of regulatory responsibilities?which involve the delivery of obligations rather than just services.In order to construct more balanced prescriptions for reform, Sparrow invites us to reconsider the central purpose of social regulation?the abatement or control of risks to society. He recounts the experiences of pioneering agencies that have confronted the risk-control challenge directly, developing operational capacities for specifying risk-concentrations, problem areas, or patterns of noncompliance, and then designing interventions tailored to each problem. At the heart of a new regulatory craftsmanship, according to Sparrow, lies the central notion, ""pick important problems and fix them."" This beguilingly simple idea turns out to present enormously complex implementation challenges and carries with it profound consequences for the way regulators organize their work, manage their discretion, and report their performance. Although the book is primarily aimed at regulatory and law-enforcement practitioners, it will also be invaluable for legislators, overseers, and others who care about the nature and quality of regulatory practice, and who want to know what kind of performance to demand from regulators and how it might be delivered. It stresses the enormous benefit to society that might accrue from development of the risk-control art as a core professional skill for regulators.","2000","http://books.google.es/books?id=wAdUjtKxyQYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risks&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api","0815780656",

"Balancing Risks. Great Power Intervention in the Periphery","risks","[Jeffrey W. Taliaferro]","[Business & Economics]","Great powers often initiate risky military and diplomatic inventions in far-off, peripheral regions that pose no direct threat to them, risking direct confrontation with rivals in strategically inconsequential places. Why do powerful countries behave in a way that leads to entrapment in prolonged, expensive, and self-defeating conflicts?Jeffrey W. Taliaferro suggests that such interventions are driven by the refusal of senior officials to accept losses in their state's relative power, international status, or prestige. Instead of cutting their losses, leaders often continue to invest blood and money in failed excursions into the periphery. Their policies may seem to be driven by rational concerns about power and security, but Taliaferro deems them to be at odds with the master explanation of political realism.Taliaferro constructs a ""balance-of-risk"" theory of foreign policy that draws on defensive realism (in international relations) and prospect theory (in psychology). He illustrates the power of this new theory in several case narratives: Germany's initiation and escalation of the 1905 and 1911 Moroccan crises, the United States' involvement in the Korean War in 195052, and Japan's entanglement in the second Sino-Japanese war in 193740 and its decisions for war with the U.S. in 194041.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=9iHfPEcCR6AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risks&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api","0801442214",

"The Risks of Financial Institutions","risks","[Mark Carey, René M. Stulz]","[Business & Economics]","Until about twenty years ago, the consensus view on the cause of financial-system distress was fairly simple: a run on one bank could easily turn to a panic involving runs on all banks, destroying some and disrupting the financial system. Since then, however, a series of eventssuch as emerging-market debt crises, bond-market meltdowns, and the Long-Term Capital Management episodehas forced a rethinking of the risks facing financial institutions and the tools available to measure and manage these risks. The Risks of Financial Institutions examines the various risks affecting financial institutions and explores a variety of methods to help institutions and regulators more accurately measure and forecast risk. The contributors--from academic institutions, regulatory organizations, and banking--bring a wide range of perspectives and experience to the issue. The result is a volume that points a way forward to greater financial stability and better risk management of financial institutions.","2007-11-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=mTWtpwkGYGgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risks&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","9780226092980",

Peter Neumann analyzes the failure modes, recommends sequences for prevention and ends his unique book with some broadening reflections on the future."" Ralph Nader, Consumer Advocate This book is much more than a collection of computer mishaps; it is a serious, technically oriented book written by one of the world's leading experts on computer risks. The book summarizes many real events involving computer technologies and the people who depend on those technologies, with widely ranging causes and effects. It considers problems attributable to hardware, software, people, and natural causes. Examples include disasters (such as the Black Hawk helicopter and Iranian Airbus shootdowns, the Exxon Valdez, and various transportation accidents); malicious hacker attacks; outages of telephone systems and computer networks; financial losses; and many other strange happenstances (squirrels downing power grids, and April Fool's Day pranks). Computer-Related Risks addresses problems involving reliability, safety, security, privacy, and human well-being. It includes analyses of why these cases happened and discussions of what might be done to avoid recurrences of similar events. It is readable by technologists as well as by people merely interested in the uses and limits of technology. It is must reading for anyone with even a remote involvement with computers and communicationswhich today means almost everyone.

"Actuarial Theory for Dependent Risks. Measures, Orders and Models","risks","[Michel Denuit, Jan Dhaene, Marc Goovaerts, Rob Kaas]","[Business & Economics]","The increasing complexity of insurance and reinsurance products has seen a growing interest amongst actuaries in the modelling of dependent risks. For efficient risk management, actuaries need to be able to answer fundamental questions such as: Is the correlation structure dangerous? And, if yes, to what extent? Therefore tools to quantify, compare, and model the strength of dependence between different risks are vital. Combining coverage of stochastic order and risk measure theories with the basics of risk management and stochastic dependence, this book provides an essential guide to managing modern financial risk. * Describes how to model risks in incomplete markets, emphasising insurance risks. * Explains how to measure and compare the danger of risks, model their interactions, and measure the strength of their association. * Examines the type of dependence induced by GLM-based credibility models, the bounds on functions of dependent risks, and probabilistic distances between actuarial models. * Detailed presentation of risk measures, stochastic orderings, copula models, dependence concepts and dependence orderings. * Includes numerous exercises allowing a cementing of the concepts by all levels of readers. * Solutions to tasks as well as further examples and exercises can be found on a supporting website. An invaluable reference for both academics and practitioners alike, Actuarial Theory for Dependent Risks will appeal to all those eager to master the up-to-date modelling tools for dependent risks. The inclusion of exercises and practical examples makes the book suitable for advanced courses on risk management in incomplete markets. Traders looking for practical advice on insurance markets will also find much of interest.","2006-05-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=J2J3-l6i56gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risks&hl=&cd=52&source=gbs_api","9780470016442",

"Radiation Risks in Perspective","risks","[Kenneth L. Mossman]","[Technology & Engineering]","Public misperception of radiological risk consistently directs limited resources toward managing minimal or even phantom risks at great cost to government and industry with no measurable benefit to overall public health. The publics inability to comprehend small theoretical risks arrived at through inherently uncertain formulae, coupled with an irrational push to eliminate all risk with no contextual understanding of overall benefit, results in a forfeiture of valuable advances in technology in favor of an illusion of safety. Radiation Risks in Perspective uses general concepts underlying radiological risk as a model to illuminate the fundamental problems in public perception, reaction, and policy when faced with possible health risks. Presenting three distinct themes, the author summarizes the causes for the failure of the current system and proposes methods for correction. Beginning with a discussion of the methods used to measure threat, the author weighs the nebulous assessment of risk with the use of a quantifiable assessment of hazardous dose, which uses actual numbers that the public can readily understand and that decision makers can confidently use to enact policy and measure success. Secondly, the author addresses the contextual balancing of cost versus benefit when prioritizing expenditure, specifically emphasizing that it is inappropriate to analyze and discuss individual risks without regard to the presence of other risks. Finally, the author analyzes the publics tendency to push toward zero risk tolerance, an extremist approach that leads to unreasonable restrictions on technologies, excessive regulatory compliance costs, and the ultimate loss of goods and services. With detailed explanations and illustrative case studies, Radiation Risks in Perspective offers scientists, lawyers, engineers, policy makers, and public health professionals, the skills they need for a rational evaluation of risk.","2010-12-12","http://books.google.es/books?id=kZoypwiQ-XwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risks&hl=&cd=57&source=gbs_api","0849379784",

"The Risks of Knowledge. Investigations Into the Death of the Hon. Minister John Robert Ouko in Kenya, 1990","risks","[David William Cohen]","[Biography & Autobiography]","Among the probes was an extensive 1990 inquiry organized by a New Scotland Yard team invited to Kenya by the government, as well as an open public commission of inquiry appointed by President Daniel arap Moi. The commission ran for seventeen months in 1990-91 before the president shut it down. International and Kenyan unrest over Ouko's brutal death brought increasing attention to corruption and violence associated with the Moi government, leading in late 1991 to multiparty politics and in December 2002 to the elections that ended the Moi era. This powerfully argued book raises important issues about the production of knowledge and the politics of memory that will interest a large interdisciplinary audience. An inquiry into how facts are created and knowledge produced, The Risks of Knowledge pursues a ghastly murder into the normally unseen worlds of international business wheeling and dealing, into the rural ""squireocracy"" of western Kenya, and into the bureaucratic routines of Kenya's government. In this, their third coauthored study of Kenya, the authors show how these unfinished investigations are about much more than the solution to the murder of a distinguished Kenyan statesman and world citizen.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=JOHBLpEmiEAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risks&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api","9780821415979",

"Managing the risks of organizational accidents","risks","[J. T. Reason]","[Business & Economics]","Major accidents are rare events due to the many barriers, safeguards and defences developed by modern technologies. But they continue to happen with saddening regularity and their human and financial consequences are all too often unacceptably catastrophic. One of the challenges facing the next millennium is to develop more effective ways of both understanding and limiting their occurrence.This lucid book presents a set of common principles to further our knowledge of the causes of major accidents in a wide variety of high technology systems. It also describes tools and techniques for managing the risks of such organizational accidents that go beyond those currently available to system managers and safety professionals.The Author deals comprehensively with the prevention of major accidents arising from human and organizational causes. He argues that the same general principles and management techniques are appropriate for many different domains. These include banks and insurance companies just as much as nuclear power plants, oil exploration and production companies, chemical process installations and air, sea and rail transport.Its unique combination of principles and practicalities make this book essential reading for those people whose daily business is to manage, audit and regulate hazardous technologies of all kinds. It is relevant to those concerned with understanding and controlling human and organizational factors and will also interest academic readers and those working in industrial and government agencies.","1997","http://books.google.es/books?id=ZnhRAAAAMAAJ&q=risks&dq=risks&hl=&cd=71&source=gbs_api","UOM:39015040046412",
"Supply Chain Risk. A Handbook of Assessment, Management, and Performance","risks","[George A. Zsidisin, Bob Ritchie]","[Business & Economics]","Risk is of fundamental importance in this era of the global economy. Supply chains must into account the uncertainty of demand. Moreover, the risk of uncertain demand can cut two ways: (1) there is the risk that unexpected demand will not be met on time, and the reverse problem (2) the risk that demand is over estimated and excessive inventory costs are incurred. There are other risks in unreliable vendors, delayed shipments, natural disasters, etc. In short, there are a host of strategic, tactical and operational risks to business supply chains. SUPPLY CHAIN RISK: A Handbook of Assessment, Management, and Performance will focus on how to assess, evaluate, and control these various risks.","2008-09-08","http://books.google.es/books?id=nrThOSr_XWoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risks&hl=&cd=72&source=gbs_api","9780387799346",

In the course of an onward globalisation and with an increasing stress of competition, it becomes more and more difficult for entrepreneurs to keep or to improve their market position. For this account, strategic planning comes into the main focus to choose the best strategy for a business. However, every business man knows that there are always chances and risks in economic life. For this reason, risks cannot be eliminated, but they can be managed. Especially in the airline industry, the competition is on a very high level. Since 2001 more and more low cost carriers have been competing with the big well known national airline companies like Lufthansa or British Airways. That's why a well thought out strategic management, strategic planning and of course risk management are essential to overcome the stress of competition. This report will analyse why risk management is so important in strategic planning. By evaluating different models and techniques, the best method to analyse the internal and external environment will be elaborated. By using a current business paper, in that case the annual report of British Airways Plc 2007, different kinds of risks will be analysed and strategies will be given, to overcome and mitigate those risks.","2013-10","http://books.google.es/books?id=tdHxtGfJQ68C&printsec=frontcover&dq=risks&hl=&cd=77&source=gbs_api","9783640862290",
