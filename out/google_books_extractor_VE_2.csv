"Propulsion System Flow Stability Program (Dynamic). Part II. Catalog of Transients Causing Propulsion System Instability","intitle:system+intitle:instability","[Earl H. Kaplan, NORTH AMERICAN ROCKWELL CORP LOS ANGELES CA LOS ANGELES DIV.]",,"A catalog of transients which have or might be expected to cause propulsion system instabilities was compiled. The transients are listed in four categories according to their source: (1) Atmosphere and External Environment, (2) Aircraft Attitude and Operating Condition, (3) Air Induction System Operating Conditions, and ((4) Engine Operating Conditions. Information for each transient is listed under the following descriptive headings: Significant Characteristic of the Transient, Signature, Transfer Mechanism, End Effect, Probability of Occurrence, and Potential Parameters for Sensing Transients. Additional information is presented in Appendices. (Author).","1968","http://books.google.es/books?id=MxSfNwAACAAJ&dq=intitle:system%2Bintitle:instability&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","OCLC:227657646",

In the absence of damping in its hinges, this system, which is an example of a quasi-dynamic system, possesses multiple regions of stability and instability and can become unstable through divergence only. It is shown that the state of divergence may be attained whenever the natural frequency of the system either vanishes or becomes infinite. When damping is present in its hinges, the system becomes unstable through either divergence characterized by a vanishing frequency or by flutter. For very slight damping, the value of the critical flutter load is less than that of the critical load of divergence whose onset is characterized by an infinite frequency in the associated non-dissipative system.","1976","http://books.google.es/books?id=esnVtgAACAAJ&dq=intitle:system%2Bintitle:instability&hl=&cd=83&source=gbs_api","OCLC:227411433",

"Combustion Instability in an Acid-Heptane Rocket with a Pressurized-Gas Propellant Pumping System","intitle:system+intitle:instability","[Adelbert O. Tischler, Donald R. Bellman, Nasa Technical Reports Server (Ntrs)]",,"Results of experimental measurements of low-frequency combustion instability of a 300-pound thrust acid-heptane rocket engine were compared to the trends predicted by an analysis of combustion instability in a rocket engine with a pressurized-gas propellant pumping system. The simplified analysis, which assumes a monopropellant model, was based on the concept of a combustion the delay occurring from the moment of propellant injection to the moment of propellant combustion. This combustion time delay was experimentally measured; the experimental values were of approximately half the magnitude predicted by the analysis. The pressure-fluctuation frequency for a rocket engine with a characteristic length of 100 inches and operated at a combustion-chamber pressure of 280 pounds per square inch absolute was 38 cycles per second; the analysis indicated. a frequency of 37 cycles per second. Increasing combustion-chamber characteristic length decreased the pressure-fluctuation frequency, in conformity to the analysis. Increasing the chamber operating pressure or increasing the injector pressure drop increased the frequency. These latter two effects are contrary to the analysis; the discrepancies are attributed to the conflict between the assumptions made to simplify the analysis and the experimental conditions. Oxidant-fuel ratio had no apparent effect on the experimentally measured pressure-fluctuation frequency for acid-heptane ratios from 3.0 to 7.0. The frequencies decreased with increased amplitude of the combustion-chamber pressure variations. The analysis indicated that if the combustion time delay were sufficiently short, low-frequency combustion instability would be eliminated.","2013-07","http://books.google.es/books?id=q2uangEACAAJ&dq=intitle:system%2Bintitle:instability&hl=&cd=95&source=gbs_api","1289265658",

The technical challenges associated with creating the necessary infrastructure to pursue a goal as costly and complex as the development of nuclear weapons are examined in the two cases as well. Finally, the role of other nations that made the development of these capabilities possible - more rapidly than either country could have done independently - is an important variable also considered/examined in this paper.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=G8SvNQAACAAJ&dq=intitle:system%2Bintitle:instability&hl=&cd=100&source=gbs_api","OCLC:213466522",

Sub-scale test methods and configurations are presented with an analysis of physical generation of cavitation compliance in turbo-pumps. Preliminary test results indicate that inexpensive commercial turbo-pumps can be used effectively to study cavitation phenomenon in rocket-engine propulsion systems. System excitation by oscillation of the pump assembly is accompanied by a high noise content in the system response. A comparison with a piston pulser in the discharge line is considered.

A total of eighteen tests were conducted over a prescribed mixture ratio range of 2.0 to 3.0 and at two different chamber pressure levels, 300 and 500 psia. A pulse gun stability rating device was used to artificially perturb the combustion process. Relative stability characteristics were compared by considering the combustion system response to induced pressure disturbances, size of disturbance required for instability, damping characteristics and resultant instability modes and oscillation amplitudes.
