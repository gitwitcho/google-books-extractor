"Sovereign Natural Disaster Insurance for Developing Countries: A Paradigm Shift in Catastrophe Risk Financing","intitle:risk+intitle:catastrophe","[Francis Ghesquiere]","[Banks and Banking Reform]","Abstract: Economic theory suggests that countries should ignore uncertainty for public investment and behave as if indifferent to risk because they can pool risks to a much greater extent than private investors can. This paper discusses the general economic theory in the case of developing countries. The analysis identifies several cases where the government's risk-neutral assumption does not hold, thus making rational the use of ex ante risk financing instruments, including sovereign insurance. The paper discusses the optimal level of sovereign insurance. It argues that, because sovereign insurance is usually more expensive than post-disaster financing, it should mainly cover immediate needs, while long-term expenditures should be financed through post-disaster financing (including ex post borrowing and tax increases). In other words, sovereign insurance should not aim at financing the long-term resource gap, but only the short-term liquidity need.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=ICU9_erB6DQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:catastrophe&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","Sovereign Natural D",
"Catastrophe Risk Financing in Developing Countries. Principles for Public Intervention","intitle:risk+intitle:catastrophe","[J. David Cummins, Olivier Mahul]","[Political Science]","'Catastrophe Risk Financing in Developing Countries' provides a detailed analysis of the imperfections and inefficiencies that impede the emergence of competitive catastrophe risk markets in developing countries. The book demonstrates how donors and international financial institutions can assist governments in middle- and low-income countries in promoting effective and affordable catastrophe risk financing solutions. The authors present guiding principles on how and when governments, with assistance from donors and international financial institutions, should intervene in catastrophe insurance markets. They also identify key activities to be undertaken by donors and institutions that would allow middle- and low-income countries to develop competitive and cost-effective catastrophe risk financing strategies at both the macro (government) and micro (household) levels. These principles and activities are expected to inform good practices and ensure desirable results in catastrophe insurance projects. 'Catastrophe Risk Financing in Developing Countries' offers valuable advice and guidelines to policy makers and insurance practitioners involved in the development of catastrophe insurance programs in developing countries.","2009","http://books.google.es/books?id=B8JjAGAc9TIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:catastrophe&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","9780821377369",

The book is based on research and state-of-the art models developed at IIASA (International Institute for applied Systems Analysis) and within its cooperation network. It addresses the methodological complexities of assessing disaster risks, which call for stochastic simulation, optimization methods and economic modeling. Furthermore, it describes policy frameworks for integrated disaster risk management, including stakeholder participation facilitated by user-interactive decision-support tools. Applications and results are presented for a number of case studies at different problem scales and in different socio-economic contexts, and their implications for loss sharing policies and economic development are discussed. Among others, the book presents studies for insurance policies for earthquakes in the Tuscany region in Italy and flood risk in the Tisza river basin in Hungary. Further, it investigates the economic impact of natural disasters on development and possible financial coping strategies; and applications are shown for selected South Asian countries. The book is addressed both to researchers and to organizations involved with catastrophe risk management and risk mitigation policies.","2012-12-11","http://books.google.es/books?id=HGqW9q5Z4cAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:catastrophe&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","9789400722262",
"Catastrophe : Risk and Response. Risk and Response","intitle:risk+intitle:catastrophe","[Richard A. Posner Senior Lecturer University of Chicago Law School]","[Science]","Catastrophes, whether natural or man-made, that could destroy the human race are often dismissed as alarmist or fanciful, the stuff of science fiction. In fact the risk of such disasters is real, and growing. A collision with an asteroid that might kill a quarter of humanity in 24 hours and the rest soon after; irreversible global warming that might flip, precipitating ""snowball earth;"" voraciously replicating nanomachines; a catastrophic accident in a particle accelerator that might reduce the earth to a hyperdense sphere 100 meters across; a pandemic of gene-spliced smallpox launched by bioterrorists; even conquest by superintelligent robots-all these potential extinction events, and others, are within the realm of the possible and warrant serious thought about assessment and prevention. They are attracting the concern of reputable scientists--but not of the general public or the nation's policymakers. How should the nation and the world respond to disaster possibilities that, for a variety of psychological and cultural reasons, people find it hard to wrap their minds around? Richard Posner shows that what is needed is a fresh, thoroughly interdisciplinary perspective that will meld the insights of lawyers, economists, psychologists, and other social scientists with those of the physical sciences. Responsibility for averting catastrophe cannot be left either to scientists or to politicians and other policymakers ignorant of science. As in many of his previous books, Posner brings law and the social sciences to bear on a contemporary problem-in this case one of particular urgency. Weighing the risk and the possible responses in each case, Posner shows us what to worry about and what to dismiss, and discusses concrete ways of minimizing the most dangerous risks. Must we yield a degree of national sovereignty in order to deal effectively with global warming? Are limitations on our civil liberties a necessary and proper response to the danger of bioterror attacks? Would investing more heavily in detection and interception systems for menacing asteroids be money well-spent? How far can we press cost-benefit analysis in the design of responses to world-threatening events? Should the institutional framework of science policy be altered? we need educational reform? Is the interface of law and science awry? These are but a few of the issues canvassed in this fascinating, disturbing, and necessary book.","2004-11-11","http://books.google.es/books?id=SDe59lXSrY8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:catastrophe&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","9780195346398",
"The Financing of Catastrophe Risk","intitle:risk+intitle:catastrophe","[Kenneth A. Froot]","[Business & Economics]","Is it possible that the insurance and reinsurance industries cannot handle a major catastrophe? Ten years ago, the notion that the overall cost of a single catastrophic event might exceed $10 billion was unthinkable. With ever increasing property-casualty risks and unabated growth in hazard-prone areas, insurers and reinsurers now envision the possibility of disaster losses of $50 to $100 billion in the United States. Against this backdrop, the capitalization of the insurance and reinsurance industries has become a crucial concern. While it remains unlikely that a single event might entirely bankrupt these industries, a big catastrophe could place firms under severe stress, jeopardizing both policy holders and investors and causing profound ripple effects throughout the U.S. economy. The Financing of Catastrophe Risk assembles an impressive roster of experts from academia and industry to explore the disturbing yet realistic assumption that a large catastrophic event is inevitable. The essays offer tangible means of both reassessing and raising the level of preparedness throughout the insurance and reinsurance industries.","2007-12-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=6kXph_NvBFMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:catastrophe&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","0226266257",

LTI has the potential to significantly increase social welfare by reducing insurers' administrative costs, lowering search costs and uncertainty for consumers and providing incentives for long-term investment in mitigation measures to protect property. A two-period model illustrates situations that would make a long-term contract attractive to both insurers and consumers under competitive market conditions.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=0v04mwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:catastrophe&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api","OCLC:500602441",

"Risk and Financial Catastrophe","intitle:risk+intitle:catastrophe","[Erik Banks]","[Business & Economics]","Risk and Financial Catastrophe presents an in-depth discussion of the nature and consequences of financial disasters and the pragmatic solutions that must be considered in order to cope with such crises in the future. This highly topical book tackles technical issues in a readable, non-mathematical way and presents the subject in practical light with the use of eight case studies of market-wide, international catastrophes. The book is divided into three parts: Part I, The Nature of Catastrophe, sets the stage by presenting a taxonomy of risk and placing non-catastrophic and catastrophic exposures into an overall framework. This section also considers the unique properties of catastrophe, exploring both natural and man-made events in relation to frequency, severity and financial impact, as well as the specific nature and formation of financial disasters and how individual institutions, and the financial system at large, respond to such crises. Part II, The Risk Framework, presents the processes commonly used in the corporate world to deal with risks, noting how such processes may be suitable for non-catastrophic events, but not for extreme events. This section also considers a series of techniques, tools and models that are available to help quantify catastrophic risk, illustrating their use in a practical sense while also analyzing their limitations. Part III, Practical Management, moves into the practical dimension of the topic by analyzing a series of past disasters (including the emerging debt crisis of the 1980s, the October 1987 Crash, the Japanese banking crisis of the 1990s, the Southeast Asian Crisis of 1997, the Russia/LTCM dislocation of 1998 and the Credit Crisis which began in 2007), considering the relevant 'lessons learned, ' and then proposing a series of prescriptive measures to cope with future disasters.","2009-10-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=WeRRPgAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:catastrophe&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api","0230577318",

Excerpt: ...taking than would a reinsurer with whom the insurer has done business for years. To minimize moral hazard, most catastrophe bonds are triggered by objective measures ( also referred to as "" nonindemnity "" based coverage ) such as wind speed during a hurricane or ground movement during an earthquake rather than insurer loss experience ( indemnity-based ). However, nonindemnity based coverage exposes insurers to "" basis risk, "" which is the risk that the proceeds from the catastrophe bond will not be related to the insurer's loss experience. For example, if a hurricane with a specified wind speed occurs, the insurer would automatically receive the proceeds of the catastrophe bond, which may be either higher or lower than its actual losses. See appendix III for additional information on the structure of catastrophe bonds. Because insurance markets have been severely disrupted by catastrophic events, state and federal governments also have taken a variety of steps to enhance the capacity of insurers to address catastrophic risk. For example, Florida established FHCF to address hurricane risk, and California established CEA to address earthquake risk. Although these programs cover different risks and use different strategies as described in this report, they share a similar goal in ensuring that insurers can withstand catastrophic events and continue to make coverage available. Similarly, Congress enacted TRIA in 2002 to ensure the continued availability of terrorism insurance subsequent to the September 11 attacks. TRIA was designed as a temporary program that would remain in place until the end of 2005, when it was expected that insurers and reinsurers would have had time to establish a market for terrorism insurance. However, Congress is currently considering extending the 2005 deadline due to concerns about w...","2011-10","http://books.google.es/books?id=8sUKywAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:catastrophe&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api","1234307405",
"Catastrophe Bonds, Reinsurance, and the Optimal Collateralization of Risk-transfer","intitle:risk+intitle:catastrophe","[Darius Lakdawalla, George Zanjani]","[Reinsurance]","Catastrophe bonds feature full collateralization of the underlying risk transfer, and thus abandon the insurance principle of economizing on collateral through diversification. We examine the theoretical foundations beneath this paradox, finding that fully collateralized instruments have important uses in a risk transfer market when insurers cannot contract completely over the division of assets in the event of insolvency, and, more generally, cannot write contracts with a full menu of state-contingent payments. In this environment, insureds have different levels of exposure to an insurer's default. When contracting constraints limit the insurer's ability to smooth out such differences, catastrophe bonds can be used to deliver coverage to those most exposed to default. We demonstrate how catastrophe bonds can improve welfare in this way by mitigating differences in default exposure, which arise with: (1) contractual incompleteness, and (2) heterogeneity among insureds, which undermines the efficiency of the mechanical pro rata division of assets that takes place in the event of insurer insolvency.","2006","http://books.google.es/books?id=9-IwqAAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:catastrophe&hl=&cd=67&source=gbs_api","OCLC:255773502",

Several behavioural biases lead decision-makers not to invest in adaptation measures until after it is too late. In an interdependent world with no intervention by the public sector, it may be economically rational for those at risk not to invest in protective measures. Risk management strategies that involve private-public partnerships that address these issues may help in reducing future catastrophic losses. These may include multi-year insurance contracts, well-enforced regulations, third-party inspections, and alternative risk transfer instruments such as catastrophe bonds.","2012","http://books.google.es/books?id=_qWzMwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:catastrophic&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api","OCLC:795699364",

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding this ACA important issue, and this is not a partisan issue but an important issue of protecting America against a terrorism attack. The fifth anniversary of 9 / 11 serves as a reminder that we live in different times and must guard against economic cost of future terrorism at-tack.he T Terrorism Insurance Act, TRIA, has been an important safe-ty net and has played a critical role in helping protect our Nation against this risk. Post-9 / 11, it is clear that a Federal backstop for terrorism insurance is essential. The GAO report which informed us that the private sector has not fully developed the capacity to provide coverage for terrorism risk also confirms the need for Federal involvement. Without a Federal reinsurance backstop, insurance will include the type of coverage from the policy. Tens of thousands of jobs will be lost, and thousands of additional bankruptcies could occur compared to what we saw in 9 / 11. Our constituents, small businesses, property owners, and com-munities everywhere need protection. It is critical that they have access to coverage that are at affordable rates, at affordable rates.

In my first essay, ""Modeling Yield Distribution in High Risk Counties: Application to Texas Upland Cotton"", I develop models of yield distributions for crops and regions whose yields exhibit irregular behavior. Specifically, I undertake a statistical case study of Texas upland cotton, which in recent years has exhibited poor actuarial performance under the U.S. crop insurance program, and propose an alternative mixture distribution model in which the conditional distribution of yield depends upon an observable drought index. The results indicate that the mixture distribution model provides a better fit to the data than conventional parametric distributions and, for more than two-thirds of the Texas counties examined, implies Group Risk Plan insurance premium rates that are greater than those currently published by the U.S. Department of Agricultural Risk Management Agency.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=UEmyuAAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:catastrophic&hl=&cd=50&source=gbs_api","1109984014",
"Effects of the Affordable Care Act on Consumer Health Care Spending and Risk of Catastrophic Health Costs","intitle:risk+intitle:catastrophic","[Sarah Nowak, Christine Eibner, David M. Adamson, Evan Saltzman, RAND Health, Rand Corporation, Commonwealth Fund]",,"This study examines the likely effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on average annual consumer health care spending and the risk of catastrophic medical costs for the United States overall and in two large states that have decided not to expand their Medicaid programs (Texas and Florida). The ACA will have varied impacts on individuals0?9 and families0?9 spending on health care, depending on income level and on estimated 2016 insurance status without the ACA. The authors find that average out-of-pocket spending is expected to decrease for all groups considered in the analysis, although decreases in out-of-pocket spending will be largest for those who would otherwise be uninsured. People who would otherwise be uninsured who transition to the individual market under the ACA will have higher total health care spending on average after implementation of the ACA because they will now incur the cost of health insurance premiums. The authors also find that risk of catastrophic health care spending will decrease for individuals of all income levels for the insurance transitions considered; decreases will be greatest for those at the lowest income levels. Case studies found that in Texas and Florida, Medicaid expansion would substantially reduce out-of-pocket and total health care spending for those with incomes below 100 percent of the federal poverty level, compared with a scenario in which the ACA is implemented without Medicaid expansion. Expansion would reduce the risk of high medical spending for those covered under Medicaid who would remain uninsured without expansion.","2013","http://books.google.es/books?id=LIwanwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:catastrophic&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api","OCLC:867481354",
"Analyzing Risk and Catastrophic Accidents: Using LOPA and Human Factors to Improve Safety in Generic Projects","intitle:risk+intitle:catastrophic","[Siddharth B.

Identifying unacceptable risks and making provisions to mitigate those, can reduce the uncertainty in the project and ensure its smooth completion and closure. Various techniques have been developed over time to identify and quantify risks. Inspite of all the available research on risk management tools, accidents continue to happen and projects consistently fail. The objective of this study is to first, determine the generic risks that can be encountered by a project. A list of generic risks will be prepared and validated by surveying managers from various industries. These risks will be prioritized to provide managers with a generic risk matrix which can be readily applied to cross-industry projects. The second part of the study involves the use of Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA), to analyze two past catastrophic accidents. The financial industry and the Space Shuttle program will be considered to produce the required analysis. LOPA models will be created to expose shortcomings in the failed projects and provide lessons to be learned in order to avoid future disasters. This research will provide a unique direction and a new tool for project managers to deploy this technique of building protection layers to prevent, protect and/or mitigate risks encountered by their system/project""--Abstract, Leaf iv.","2012","http://books.google.es/books?id=3t2JnQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:catastrophic&hl=&cd=52&source=gbs_api","OCLC:843766531",

Results of Pressure Vessel Test with a Large Vessel (HC2-test)","intitle:risk+intitle:catastrophic","[Heikki Keinänen, Valtion teknillinen tutkimuskeskus]","[Fracture mechanics]","Within the Nordic countries a four-year research programme in the area of elastic-plastic fracture mechanics was initiated in 1985. Seven laboratories from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden are participating in the programme. The main technical objective of the programme is to clarify how catastrophic fracture can be prevented in pressure vessels and piping by using the leak-before-break concept. The major experimental effort of the programme is destructive pressurisation of a large size pressure vessel up to rupture. The vessel has dimensions similar to a nuclear reactor pressure vessel, and it has been in operation for 20 years in a Finnish oil refinery plant. The materials characterisation of the vessel has been partially carried out within an extensive Nordic round-robin programme. Two pressure tests have been carried out. In both tests an artificial sharp axial surface flaw was made on the inner wall of the vessel. The experimental details of the last test including repair welding of the vessel, flaw preparation, instrumentation and material characterisation are described in this report. The fracture behaviour as well as experimental results are reported. The failure pressure is compared to estimates of the analytical pre-test calculations.

Évaluation et systèmes de données]","[Traffic accidents]","Traffic safety managers are constantly faced with the problem of making decisions on which, and of these the best, measures and countermeasures to implement for addressing their main goal - improving road safety. The ability to make these decisions effectively is dependent upon the availability of suitable and contemporary research information on the incidence of travel and accidents occurring on our roads and highways. To this end an area crucial to traffic safety research is the development of evaluation methods for measuring and subsequently identifying high risk travel patterns. This component of the countermeasure development process is difficult to pursue since the overall risk of accident occurrence is directly affected by the joint interactive effects of numerous human, vehicle, road/infrastructure, environment, trip and temporal travel pattern risk levels existing within the transportation system. Other factors (e.g., countermeasure programs, economic conditions, vehicle/driver regulations, social factors) also influence the prevailing risk levels, at any given time, for road system users. This report discusses various aspects of an exposure (to risk) data collection system that forms the basis for developing a risk analysis sytem in order to measure and monitor road travel incident risks. Specifically, the relationships among causal factors, risk levels and incidence of accidents, injuries and fatalities are presented. The conceptual concepts of a risk analysis system process for measuring, monitoring and improving road safety are described. The 'key' information requirements to be considered within the framework of an exposure (to risk) data collection system are identified. A variety of methods are available from collecting exposure (to risk) information - these are discussed along with factors to be considered in their implementation. The applications and uses of exposure (to risk) information towards the main objective of making road travel 'safer' are also discussed. The report concludes with a discussion of the 1978-1979 National Exposure (To Risk) Driving Survey - the other effort, to date, to collect national exposure (to risk) data, and offers some conclusions and recommendations related to the development and implementation of a 'risk analysis system' for measuring and monitoring the levels of risk on Canada's roads and highways.","1998","http://books.google.es/books?id=WzAxHQAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:accident&hl=&cd=91&source=gbs_api","OCLC:270340640",

To analyze risk, a flight was divided into four risk areas: takeoff, inflight, transition, and landing. Accidents were assumed to occur according to a Poisson process and tests were carried out to prove the validity of the Poisson assumption. The poisson model yielded two factors, the exposure to the risk areas and the performance in them. A procedure to predict risk was developed. A statistic, improvement index, was developed to allow a direct comparison between different types of aircraft with respect to safety performance.

"Quantifying and Controlling Catastrophic Risks","intitle:risks+intitle:catastrophic","[B. John Garrick]","[Technology & Engineering]","The perception, assessment and management of risk are increasingly important core principles for determining the development of both policy and strategic responses to civil and environmental catastrophes. Whereas these principles were once confined to some areas of activity i.e. financial and insurance, they are now widely used in civil and environmental engineering. Comprehensive and readable, Civil and Environmental Risk: Mitigation and Control, provides readers with the mathematical tools and quantitative methods for determining the probability of a catastrophic event and mitigating and controlling the aftermath. With this book engineers develop the required skills for accurately assessing risk and formulating appropriate response strategies. The two part treatment starts with a clear and rigorous exposition of the quantitative risk assessment process, followed by self-contained chapters concerning applications. One of the first books to address both natural and human generated disasters, topics include events such as pandemic diseases, climate changes, major hurricanes, super earthquakes, mega tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, industrial accidents and terrorist attacks. Case studies appear at the end of the book allowing engineers to see how these principles are applied to scenarios such as a super hurricane or mega tsunamis, a reactor core melt down in a nuclear plant, a terrorist attack on the national electric grid, and an abrupt climate change brought about by a change in the ocean currents in the North Atlantic. Written by the current Chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, Environmental risk managers will find this reference a valuable and authoritative guide both in accurately calculating risk and its applications in their work.

"Managerial Perception and Assessment of Catastrophic Supply Chain Risks","intitle:risks+intitle:catastrophic","[Simon Barth]",,"Master's Thesis from the year 2010 in the subject Business economics - Business Management, Corporate Governance, grade: 1,3, Maastricht University, language: English, abstract: Purpose - Catastrophic supply chain risks can have severe effects on companies' supply chains. Still, previous supply chain risk management research has predominantly focused on operational risks. The purpose of this study is to explore the construct of managerial risk perception and the assessment stage of catastrophic supply chain risks. Design/methodology/approach - A risky decision making model for catastrophic supply chain risks was applied in an explorative multiple case study approach. Interviews served as the main source for information. Findings - The degree of supply chain integration was found to be a prime determinant of the potential damage caused by disruptions due to catastrophic supply chain risks. The frequency of catastrophic supply chain events seems to be influenced to some degree by the number of suppliers. It is suggested that managerial perception of catastrophic supply chain risks is formed by the degree of potential damage and past exposure to catastrophic supply chain events. Several barriers to the assessment of catastrophic supply chain risks, such as missing top management priority, low supply chain risk management maturity and lack of obvious return were identified. A combination of ""softer"" supply chain risk assessment methods, expert opinions and simulation techniques have been identified to be useful to assess catastrophic supply chain risks. Originality/ value - This explorative research provides first insights into the construct of managerial risk perception in the context of catastrophic supply chain risks. Further it identifies useful risk assessment tools and techniques for catastrophic supply chain risks, based on both supply chain risk management research and catastrophe research.

"Financing Losses from Catastrophic Risks","intitle:risks+intitle:catastrophic","[U.S. Government]",,"Original publisher: Washington, D.C.: Congressional Budget Office, [2008] OCLC Number: (OCoLC)318694147 Subject: Disaster insurance -- Finance -- Government policy -- United States. Excerpt: ... Federal Tax Treatment Taxes by their nature distort some types of business decisions, but these distortions are especially severe when it comes to providing catastrophic insurance. The federal tax code currently taxes as income the earnings of an insurer that are temporarily inflated when disaster losses are low. Insurers may not count additions made to their reserves against low-probability risks as expenses for tax purposes. Instead they may expense the cost of reserves only for losses that have been reported by policyholders but that remain unsettled, as well as losses that are believed to have already occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported ( Bradford and Logue 1997 ). Taxes therefore lead insurers to raise less capital for catastrophic protection than they would otherwise. In fact, federal taxes alone can significantly raise the price of catastrophic insurance, while having only a negligible impact on noncatastrophic insurance. This difference can be seen in a simplified example of two hypothetical corporate insurers: one that provides 15 catastrophic hurricane coverage and one that insures against standard fire risk. Suppose that each insurer's portfolio of policies issued has the same expected annual average loss of $ 10 million, but that the hurricane insurer faces a single $ 1 billion loss with certainty once every 100 years, whereas losses to the fire insurer alternate between $ 8 million and $ 12 million each year. Annual premiums of $ 10 million would cover the expected costs of each. But to ensure its ability to pay claims every year, the fire insurer needs to hold only about $ 2 million in capital reserves, for those years in which losses are $ 12 million. It can take advantage of the law of large numbers ( since the underlying risks are ...","2011-09","http://books.google.es/books?id=NNzQygAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks%2Bintitle:catastrophic&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api","1234141426",

"Spatial Analysis of Bicycle Use and Accident Risks for Cyclists","intitle:risks+intitle:accident","[Grégory Vandenbulcke-Plasschaert]",,"Most developed countries nowadays face environmental, health and mobility problems as a consequence of widespread car use. Policies are now being reappraised in favour of more sustainable modes of transport. In particular, bicycle use holds the potential to provide a 'green' and healthy alternative to car commuting. There are however still important barriers that discourage people cycling... This thesis aims at identifying some of the main factors that influence cycle commuting and cycling accidents. Identifying such factors would in turn provide greater support to enable policy makers developing supportive environmental conditions for cycling. In the first part of this thesis, we examine which factors influence the spatial variation of bicycle use for commuting to work at the level of the municipalities in Belgium. Special attention is paid to bicycle-specific factors and spatial econometric methods are used to account for the presence of spatial effects in the data. The second part of this thesis examines which factors are associated with cycling accidents in Brussels. Spatial point pattern methods extended to networks are used to compare the 'locational tendencies' of cycling accidents officially registered by the police with those that are unregistered. An innovative case-control approach, based on a rigorous sampling design of controls and an exhaustive data collection of spatial factors, is also proposed to allow modelling the risk of cycling accident along the Brussels' road network. This thesis not only provides sound recommendations helping planners and policy makers to encourage bicycle use, but it also offers new research directions for pinpointing locations where accidents are more likely to occur.","2011-11-20","http://books.google.es/books?id=J2mNGXHrKb0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risks%2Bintitle:accident&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","9782875580191",

Not illustrated. 1893 Excerpt: ...party, which, though not constituting a technical assignment, may yet give a lien.2 The word is also employed to assignments of life policies by way of pledge, mortgage, or sale. The payee or person to whom the company has agreed to pay the money in the event of a loss, or the indorsee to whom the insured has directed the company to pay the same, is not the assignee of the contract or policy, but the direction by the insured to pay is an assignment of the fund that may subsequently arise under the contract,8 in which a payee may acquire a vested right.4 263. In a contract of insurance in respect of property, as has been observed, there is a dilectun personce, and the policy does not pass as an incident of the property to the alienee.8 Though a policy may be made to bearer, as in Ellicott v. U. S. Ins. Co.,1 where the company, on receiving the deposit of certain securities, guaranteed by a sealed policy to pay the bearer thereof a certain sum on a certain day, which was held to be a policy to bearer, and the holder, whether the original insured or not, is prima fade entitled to the money. It was stated in O'Connor v. Imperial Ins. Co.,2 in Lower Canada, however, by art. 2576 of the Civil Code, that the insured has in all cases the right to assign the policy with the property. 264. A policy may be assigned on a transfer of the subjectmatter if the underwriter assent, and this is usually provided for in the policy, which stipulates its being done in a particular way which must be followed. The proviso that the policy was to "" be void in case of its being assigned.... without the previous consent in writing of the insurers,"" precludes evidence of a verbal assent. But any method of assent which the insurer leads the insured to consider sufficient is al...","2012-05","http://books.google.es/books?id=lDx9LwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks%2Bintitle:accident&hl=&cd=90&source=gbs_api","1236460065",

"A Proposal for the Development of Exposure (to Risk) Information for Measuring and Monitoring Road Accident Risks. A Risk Analysis System for Improving Road Safety","intitle:risks+intitle:accident",,,"Traffic safety managers are constantly faced with the problem of making decisions on which, and of these the best, measures and countermeasures to implement for addressing their main goal - improving road safety. The ability to make these decisions effectively is dependent upon the availability of suitable and contemporary research information on the incidence of travel and accidents occurring on our roads and highways. To this end an area crucial to traffic safety research is the development of evaluation methods for measuring and subsequently identifying high risk travel patterns. This component of the countermeasure development process is difficult to pursue since the overall risk of accident occurrence is directly affected by the joint interactive effects of numerous human, vehicle, road/infrastructure, environment, trip and temporal travel pattern risk levels existing within the transportation system. Other factors (e.g., countermeasure programs, economic conditions, vehicle/driver regulations, social factors) also influence the prevailing risk levels, at any given time, for road system users. This report discusses various aspects of an exposure (to risk) data collection system that forms the basis for developing a risk analysis sytem in order to measure and monitor road travel incident risks. Specifically, the relationships among causal factors, risk levels and incidence of accidents, injuries and fatalities are presented. The conceptual concepts of a risk analysis system process for measuring, monitoring and improving road safety are described. The 'key' information requirements to be considered within the framework of an exposure (to risk) data collection system are identified. A variety of methods are available from collecting exposure (to risk) information - these are discussed along with factors to be considered in their implementation. The applications and uses of exposure (to risk) information towards the main objective of making road travel 'safer' are also discussed. The report concludes with a discussion of the 1978-1979 National Exposure (To Risk) Driving Survey - the other effort, to date, to collect national exposure (to risk) data, and offers some conclusions and recommendations related to the development and implementation of a 'risk analysis system' for measuring and monitoring the levels of risk on Canada's roads and highways.","1998","http://books.google.es/books?id=M7FrmgEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks%2Bintitle:accident&hl=&cd=92&source=gbs_api","OCLC:61474610",
